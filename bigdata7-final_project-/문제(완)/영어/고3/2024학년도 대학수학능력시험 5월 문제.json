My name is Rohan Kaul, the producer of the upcoming film ‘Upagrah.’ I am reaching out to you regarding a matter of importance concerning the shooting of some scenes for our film. We have identified Gulab Park, Mumbai, as an ideal location for these scenes. We are hoping to conduct this shoot on 3rd June 2024, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. We have chosen Monday for the shooting day to minimize traffic issues and disruption to the public. During the shoot, our team promises to follow all rules and regulations, ensuring no inconvenience is caused to the public. We would be so grateful if you granted permission for the shoot so that we can put the beautiful scenery of the park in our film. We look forward to your response. ①주말 영화 시사회에 초대하려고 ②공원 이용 시간의 연장을 건의하려고 ③촬영을 위한 장비 대여 방법을 문의하려고 ④행사 운영을 위한 교통 통제를 요청하려고 ⑤영화 촬영을 위해 장소 사용 허가를 얻으려고 19. 다음 글에 드러난 Charles의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? Charles was taking a quiz in his math class. He stared at the questions, but they looked completely unfamiliar. Charles flipped through the pages of the quiz for a while. His palms grew sweaty as he realized that he didn’t know a single answer. A moment later, a few other students began raising their hands. One said, “I don’t think we ever learned about the stuff on this quiz, Mrs. Smith.” The teacher quickly looked over a copy of the quiz and announced, “I’m sorry, class. It appears that I have given you the wrong quiz by mistake. We’ll take the right quiz next class.” As Charles heard what the teacher said, the tension in his shoulders began to melt away. ①nervous →relieved ②relaxed →regretful ③amazed →annoyed ④indifferent →satisfied ⑤shocked →sympathetic 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? When you are middle­aged, the risk of connective tissue injuries peaks as decreased load tolerance combines with continued high activity levels. The path of least resistance is to stop doing the things that hurt ― avoid uncomfortable movements and find easier forms of exercise. However, that’s the exact opposite of what you should do. There is a path forward. But it doesn’t involve following the typical pain management advice of rest, ice, and medicine, which multiple reviews have shown is not effective for treating age­related joint pain and dysfunction. These methods do nothing more than treat superficial symptoms. The only practical solution is to strengthen your body with muscle training. Whether you’ve been training for a few years or a few decades, or haven’t ever stepped foot in the weight room, it’s not too late to restore your body, build real strength, and achieve your physical potential. ①관절의 노화를 늦추기 위해 적절한 체중을 유지해야 한다. ②근육을 강화하기 위해 다양한 강도의 운동을 병행해야 한다. ③중년층은 근 손실 예방을 위해 식단을 철저히 관리해야 한다. ④노화와 관련된 관절 질환에는 치료보다 예방이 우선되어야 한다. ⑤중년에는 통증이 따르더라도 근력 운동으로 신체를 강화해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Turn the lights out and point the beam of a small flashlight up into one of your eyes. Shake the beam around while moving your gaze up and down. You should catch glimpses of what look like delicate branches. These branches are shadows of the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina. The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving. But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world. These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge. Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze! It’s an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection. * retina: 망막 ** jiggle: 가볍게 흔들다 ①What makes your vision blurry actually　protects your eyes. ②The more quickly an object moves, the more sensitively eyes react. ③Eyes exposed to intense light are subject to distortion of images. ④Constant adjustment of focusing makes your eye muscles tired. ⑤Shaky eye­muscle movements let us see what the brain might ignore. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Most opposition to wilderness preservation doesn’t come from environmentalists but from corporate interests and developers. When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won’t exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human­focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important. ①야생 보호 구역 보존의 생명 중심적 가치는 경제적 고려에 우선한다. ②자연과의 공존을 고려한 상업 활동이 기업에 경제적 이익을 가져다준다. ③야생 보호에 있어 우선적으로 고려하는 가치는 문화에 따라 다양하다. ④야생 보호는 경제적 가치와 상관없이 모든 생물에 똑같이 적용된다. ⑤야생의 보호와 회복을 위한 비용 부담은 공동체 모두의 몫이다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? During the day, a molecule called adenosine builds up in your brain. Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine’s effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, ‘Okay, every morning I’m getting this caffeine that’s binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.’ So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That’s why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect. * drowsy: 나른한 ** gland: (분비)선 ①what your brain does for regular hormone production ②consequences of sleep deprivation caused by caffeine ③connection between brain health and hormone balance ④efforts to overcome the constant temptation of caffeine ⑤how your brain adapts to a steady caffeine consumption 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? When viewed from space, one of the Earth’s most commanding features is the blueness of its vast oceans. Small amounts of water do not indicate the color of these large bodies of water; when pure drinking water is examined in a glass, it appears clear and colorless. Apparently a relatively large volume of water is required to reveal the blue color. Why is this so? When light penetrates water, it experiences both absorption and scattering. Water molecules strongly absorb infrared and, to a lesser degree, red light. At the same time, water molecules are small enough to scatter shorter wavelengths, giving water its blue­green color. The amount of long­wavelength absorption is a function of depth; the deeper the water, the more red light is absorbed. At a depth of 15m, the intensity of red light drops to 25% of its original value and falls to zero beyond a depth of 30m. Any object viewed at this depth is seen in a blue­green light. For this reason, red inhabitants of the sea, such as lobsters and crabs, appear black to divers not carrying a lamp. * penetrate: 관통하다 ** infrared: 적외선 ①We Should Go Green with the Ocean Exploration ②Various Tones of Water Our Deceptive Eyes Show Us ③How Deep­Sea Microorganisms Affect the Ocean’s Color ④Why So Blue: The Science Behind the Color of Earth’s Oceans ⑤The Bigger Volume Water Has, the Lower Temperature It Gets 4 영어 영역 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

José Saramago에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? José Saramago was born in 1922 to a family of farmers in a little village north of Lisbon. For financial reasons he abandoned his high­school studies and worked as a mechanic. At this time, he acquired a taste for reading and started to frequent a public library in Lisbon in his free time. After trying different jobs in the civil service, he worked for a publishing company for twelve years and then as an editor of the newspaper ‘Diário de Notícias.’ Between 1975 and 1980 Saramago supported himself as a translator, but after his literary successes in the 1980s he devoted himself to his own writing. He achieved worldwide recognition in 1982 with the humorous love story Baltasar and Blimunda, a novel set in 18th­century Portugal. Saramago’s oeuvre totals 30 works, and comprises not only novels but also poetry, essays and drama. * oeuvre: 전체 작품 ①재정적인 이유로 고등학교 공부를 그만두었다. ②독서에 흥미가 생겨 공립 도서관을 자주 방문하기 시작했다. ③신문사의 편집자로 일한 후 출판사에서 12년간 일했다. ④포르투갈이 배경인 소설로 세계적인 인정을 받았다. ⑤소설뿐 아니라 시, 수필, 희곡 또한 집필하였다. 27.

Charles was taking a quiz in his math class. He stared at the questions, but they looked completely unfamiliar. Charles flipped through the pages of the quiz for a while.

When you are middle­aged, the risk of connective tissue injuries peaks as decreased load tolerance combines with continued high activity levels. The path of least resistance is to stop doing the things that hurt ― avoid uncomfortable movements and find easier forms of exercise. However, that’s the exact opposite of what you should do. There is a path forward. But it doesn’t involve following the typical pain management advice of rest, ice, and medicine, which multiple reviews have shown is not effective for treating age­related joint pain and dysfunction. These methods do nothing more than treat superficial symptoms. The only practical solution is to strengthen your body with muscle training. Whether you’ve been training for a few years or a few decades, or haven’t ever stepped foot in the weight room, it’s not too late to restore your body, build real strength, and achieve your physical potential. ①관절의 노화를 늦추기 위해 적절한 체중을 유지해야 한다. ②근육을 강화하기 위해 다양한 강도의 운동을 병행해야 한다. ③중년층은 근 손실 예방을 위해 식단을 철저히 관리해야 한다. ④노화와 관련된 관절 질환에는 치료보다 예방이 우선되어야 한다. ⑤중년에는 통증이 따르더라도 근력 운동으로 신체를 강화해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Turn the lights out and point the beam of a small flashlight up into one of your eyes. Shake the beam around while moving your gaze up and down. You should catch glimpses of what look like delicate branches. These branches are shadows of the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina. The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving. But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world. These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge. Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze! It’s an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection. * retina: 망막 ** jiggle: 가볍게 흔들다 ①What makes your vision blurry actually　protects your eyes. ②The more quickly an object moves, the more sensitively eyes react. ③Eyes exposed to intense light are subject to distortion of images. ④Constant adjustment of focusing makes your eye muscles tired. ⑤Shaky eye­muscle movements let us see what the brain might ignore. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Most opposition to wilderness preservation doesn’t come from environmentalists but from corporate interests and developers. When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won’t exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human­focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important. ①야생 보호 구역 보존의 생명 중심적 가치는 경제적 고려에 우선한다. ②자연과의 공존을 고려한 상업 활동이 기업에 경제적 이익을 가져다준다. ③야생 보호에 있어 우선적으로 고려하는 가치는 문화에 따라 다양하다. ④야생 보호는 경제적 가치와 상관없이 모든 생물에 똑같이 적용된다. ⑤야생의 보호와 회복을 위한 비용 부담은 공동체 모두의 몫이다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? During the day, a molecule called adenosine builds up in your brain. Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine’s effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, ‘Okay, every morning I’m getting this caffeine that’s binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.’ So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That’s why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect. * drowsy: 나른한 ** gland: (분비)선 ①what your brain does for regular hormone production ②consequences of sleep deprivation caused by caffeine ③connection between brain health and hormone balance ④efforts to overcome the constant temptation of caffeine ⑤how your brain adapts to a steady caffeine consumption 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?

Whether you’ve been training for a few years or a few decades, or haven’t ever stepped foot in the weight room, it’s not too late to restore your body, build real strength, and achieve your physical potential.①관절의 노화를 늦추기 위해 적절한 체중을 유지해야 한다.②근육을 강화하기 위해 다양한 강도의 운동을 병행해야 한다.③중년층은 근 손실 예방을 위해 식단을 철저히 관리해야 한다.④노화와 관련된 관절 질환에는 치료보다 예방이 우선되어야 한다.⑤중년에는 통증이 따르더라도 근력 운동으로 신체를 강화해야 한다.3영어 영역38"

[3점]Turn the lights out and point the beam of a small flashlight up into one of your eyes. Shake the beam around while moving your gaze up and down. You should catch glimpses of what look like delicate branches. These branches are shadows of the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina. The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving. But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world. These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge. Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze! It’s an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is better than perfect perfection.* retina: 망막** jiggle: 가볍게 흔들다①What makes your vision blurry actually　protects your eyes.②The more quickly an object moves, the more sensitively eyes react.③Eyes exposed to intense light are subject to distortion of images.④Constant adjustment of focusing makes your eye muscles tired.⑤Shaky eye­muscle movements let us see what the brain might ignore."

When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won’t exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human­focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important.①야생 보호 구역 보존의 생명 중심적 가치는 경제적 고려에 우선한다.②자연과의 공존을 고려한 상업 활동이 기업에 경제적 이익을 가져다준다.③야생 보호에 있어 우선적으로 고려하는 가치는 문화에 따라 다양하다.④야생 보호는 경제적 가치와 상관없이 모든 생물에 똑같이 적용된다.⑤야생의 보호와 회복을 위한 비용 부담은 공동체 모두의 몫이다."

Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine’s effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, ‘Okay, every morning I’m getting this caffeine that’s binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.’ So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That’s why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect.* drowsy: 나른한  ** gland: (분비)선①what your brain does for regular hormone production②consequences of sleep deprivation caused by caffeine③connection between brain health and hormone balance④efforts to overcome the constant temptation of caffeine⑤how your brain adapts to a steady caffeine consumption"

Small amounts of water do not indicate the color of these large bodies of water; when pure drinking water is examined in a glass, it appears clear and colorless. Apparently a relatively large volume of water is required to reveal the blue color. Why is this so? When light penetrates water, it experiences both absorption and scattering. Water molecules strongly absorb infrared and, to a lesser degree, red light. At the same time, water molecules are small enough to scatter shorter wavelengths, giving water its blue­green color. The amount of long­wavelength absorption is a function of depth; the deeper the water, the more red light is absorbed. At a depth of 15m, the intensity of red light drops to 25% of its original value and falls to zero beyond a depth of 30m. Any object viewed at this depth is seen in a blue­green light. For this reason, red inhabitants of the sea, such as lobsters and crabs, appear black to divers not carrying a lamp.* penetrate: 관통하다** infrared: 적외선①We Should Go Green with the Ocean Exploration②Various Tones of Water Our Deceptive Eyes Show Us③How Deep­Sea Microorganisms Affect the Ocean’s Color④Why So Blue: The Science Behind the Color of Earth’s Oceans⑤The Bigger Volume Water Has, the Lower Temperature It Gets4영어 영역48"

After trying different jobs in the civil service, he worked for a publishing company for twelve years and then as an editor of the newspaper ‘Diário de Notícias.’ Between 1975 and 1980 Saramago supported himself as a translator, but after his literary successes in the 1980s he devoted himself to his own writing.

John Douglas Pettigrew, a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland, found that the brain manages the external world by dividing it into separate regions, the peripersonal and the extrapersonal ― basically, near and far. Peripersonal space includes whatever is in arm’s reach; things you can control right now by using your hands. This is the world of what’s real, right now. Extrapersonal space refers to everything else ― whatever you can’t touch unless you move beyond your arm’s reach, whether it’s three feet or three million miles away. This is the realm of possibility. With those definitions in place, another fact follows, obvious but useful: any interaction in the extrapersonal space must occur in the future. Or, to put it another way, . For instance, if you’re in the mood for a peach, but the closest one is sitting in a bin at the corner market, you can’t enjoy it now.

Insect­eating plants’ unique strategies for catching live prey have long captured the public imagination. But even within this strange group, in which food­trapping mechanisms have evolved multiple times independently, some unusual ones stand out. According to Ulrike Bauer, an evolutionary biologist, the visually striking pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis, for example, can . This species’ pitcher has a rigid, horizontal lid with an exposed underside that produces nectar, luring insects to land on it. When a raindrop strikes the lid’s top, the lid jolts downward and throws any unsuspecting visitor into digestive juices below.

But there are no real­life cases of time travel. (A) It seems that something must happen to prevent you from doing this, because if you were to succeed, you would not exist and so you would not have been able to go back in time. As a result of thinking through these sorts of cases, some philosophers claim that the very notion of time travel makes no sense. (B) In situations such as this, philosophers often construct thought experiments ― imagined scenarios that bring out the thoughts and presuppositions underlying people’s judgments. Sometimes these scenarios are drawn from books, movies, and television. Other times, philosophers just make up their own scenarios. (C) Either way, the point is to put such concepts to the test.

One example is color blindness. Most color blindness is associated with genes on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if this problem occurs on one of them, the other can (a) compensate. But men have only one X chromosome. If the mutation occurs there, that male is color blind. We might ask why such a (b) deficiency would survive and not die out. To understand this, we can consider ancient hunter­gatherers, with the men doing most of the hunting for meat and the women doing most of the gathering of fruits and nuts. Gathering fruits, especially berries, and nuts is much more productive if it is easy to distinguish the red or purple fruit from the green leaves of the plant. If red­green color blindness were common among women, the resulting (c) lack of productivity would likely cause this trait to die out relatively quickly. On the other hand, the men out hunting don’t much rely on being able to contrast red from green. Most of the animals they are hunting have fur or feathers that help them hide. Rather than relying on color, the hunter relies on an acute ability to detect motion. It is conceivable that a (d) reduction in color contrast in these circumstances might actually enhance one’s ability to detect subtle motions. Given that a hunted animal blends into its surroundings, less background color variation would be (e) more of a visual distraction. * chromosome: 염색체 ** mutation: 돌연변이 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ①Genetic Code: The Key to Conquering Disorders ②Ancient People’s Challenges from Genetic Weaknesses ③What Makes a Great Hunter: An Ability to Move Quickly ④In Evolution, Disadvantageous Doesn’t Mean Destined to Vanish ⑤Various Biological Factors Causing Red­Green Color Blindness 42. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? ①(a) ②(b) ③(c) ④(d) ⑤(e)",

But although they looked identical, they were different in every other way. They didn’t have anything in common, so they fought all the time. Pamela thought that (a) her sister was weird and incomprehensible, and of course Maggie felt the same way. (B) Tired of the endless arguments, their mother Rachel decided to put an end to them. She would make them understand that each of their points of view could be correct. One day, the twins were brought to the dining table where a big board stood in the middle. Pamela sat on one side of the board and (b) her twin on the other. Rachel asked Pamela what the color of the board was. “Black,” she said. (C) For example, Pamela was always upset at her sister waking up early in the morning. (c) She didn’t understand why her sister couldn’t finish what she needed to do at night and sleep peacefully the next morning. To Maggie, staying up past the time (d) she began to feel sleepy was exhausting. Besides, she loved the fresh morning air. They had fights about simple things like this every day. (D) After hearing Pamela’s answer, Rachel asked the same question to (e) the other daughter. She replied it was white. Predictably, they began arguing. Rachel then asked them to switch seats. Each sitting on a new chair, they were surprised to realize the board was black on one side and white on the other. Understanding what their mother wanted to say, they promised they would never insist the other was wrong again. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) ― (D) ― (C) ② (C) ― (B) ― (D) ③ (C) ― (D) ― (B) ④ (D) ― (B) ― (C) ⑤ (D) ― (C) ― (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ①(a) ②(b) ③(c) ④(d) ⑤(e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ①자매는 외모를 제외한 모든 면에서 서로 달랐다. ②Rachel은 두 딸의 언쟁을 끝내기로 결심했다. ③Pamela는 판자가 흰색이라고 대답했다. ④Maggie는 상쾌한 아침 공기를 좋아했다. ⑤Rachel은 두 딸이 자리를 바꾸도록 요청했다. ※ 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인 하시오.",
