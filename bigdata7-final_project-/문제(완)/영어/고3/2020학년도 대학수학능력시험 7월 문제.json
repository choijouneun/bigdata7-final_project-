Dear Ms. Martinez, We are planning to open a school for the underprivileged students of the locality at Norristown. As a non­profit organization, the school will be run only on your contributions and resources as gifts to the children we hope to help. Our outline of the school is at a primitive stage currently, and its execution and extension are hugely dependent on your donations. These children that we hope to help are often seen working in factories and cafes due to their family’s financial difficulties. It is a great disappointment that such a young population of our community is wasted and cannot see the light of education. Kindly look at our plan on our website www.dreamproject.com and donate at your convenience. We hope that you will be a part of our project and look forward to further support and encouragement.

The hotel lobby was elegant and well lit. Good, light brown woodwork and stainless steel. A short metro carriage runs through this place carrying executives. I am well dressed in a charcoal colour suit with a matching tie and black shoes. I feel great thinking I am fitted out to charm any crowd. But I forget where I’ve left my briefcase and laptop. I stop the metro and tell them that I need to check for my bag in their glass bag carriage. I find all sorts of bags except mine. I doubt whether I have brought it with me to this country at all. Mr nice guy that I am, I don’t like to keep others waiting. I let the metro move which moves quickly and is almost out of sight when I realise that one of my expensive shoes is missing! I must have left it in the cabin while looking for the bag and the metro has left. I feel myself blushing. ① nervous →relieved ② delighted → bored ③ curious →disappointed ④ surprised → indifferent ⑤ satisfied →embarrassed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Here’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve. ① 더 나은 삶과 세상을 지향하는 사람과 사귀어야 한다. ② 부모는 자녀와 교우 관계에 대해 자주 대화해야 한다. ③ 우정을 지키려면 변함없는 신의를 보여줘야 한다. ④ 원만한 인간관계를 위해 이기적인 태도를 버려야 한다. ⑤ 가족의 의사결정은 모든 구성원의 합의로 이루어져야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 faulty storytelling 이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? In recent years I’ve come to see that, amazingly, the key to almost all of our problems is faulty storytelling, because it’s storytelling that drives the way we gather and spend our energy. I believe that stories ― not the ones people tell us but the ones we tell ourselves ― determine nothing less than our personal and professional destinies. And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best ― and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story ― the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t ― it shouldn’t and won’t ― be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary. After all, you’re not just the author of your story but also its main character, the hero. Heroes are never ordinary. * scrutinize: 면밀히 조사하다 ** paleontologist: 고생물학자 ① failing to live a self­determined life ② obsessing over the regrets of the past ③ not thinking we are the same as others ④ attributing someone else’s faults to ourselves ⑤ speaking ill of others by creating a false story 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? A question can be raised about the basic notion that sensitivity to problems is critical in setting the creative process in motion. It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to. ① 논리적 사고는 창의력 발휘를 저해한다. ② 필요는 창의성 발현을 위한 필수 조건이 아니다. ③ 다양한 경험이 반드시 발명에 유익한 것은 아니다. ④ 문제 해결 능력은 문제에 대한 민감성에서 비롯된다. ⑤ 창의적 산출물을 만들기 위해 지식의 축적이 필요하다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Pet owners sometimes tire of their animals or become overwhelmed by caring for a large number of pets or a difficult pet. Rather than face the stress of turning the pet in to a shelter, owners drive pets far from their home range and abandon them. Some people believe the animal has a better chance to survive roaming free than at a shelter, a false belief formed to salve the pet abandoner’s conscience. Releasing your pet, whether a cat, rabbit, or bearded dragon, is not the answer. Typically, people report roaming dogs for pickup by animal control authorities, who take the dog to the local shelter. Cats and exotic or unusual animals, unless confined to a small area, are not usually discovered or reported. Released pets not captured and sheltered suffer from weather, wild predators, and a lack of adequate food. Some pets die a difficult death. Other released pets survive and breed successfully. In these cases, the survivor pets become an invasive species and the environment suffers. * salve: (죄책감을) 덜다 ① struggles of wild animals to survive in nature ② importance of expanding shelters for released pets ③ why pet owners should not set unwanted pets free ④ how to prevent pet owners from abandoning their pets ⑤ conditions essential to maintaining pets’ physical health 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? The borderless­world thesis has been vigorously criticized by many geographers on the grounds that it presents a simplistic and idealized vision of globalization. It appears that the more territorial borders fall apart, the more various groups around the world cling to place, nation, and religion as markers of their identity.

The performance included a composition of his own. He later studied at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music, following the lead of another eminent Hungarian composer, Ernö Dohnányi. From 1905, he began a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian Zoltán Kodály in trying to popularize Hungarian folk songs and gained a practical knowledge of string writing from both folk and classical musicians. Bartók had a successful career as a pianist, performing throughout Europe and in the United States with musicians such as the jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman. With the rise of fascism, he refused to play in Germany after 1933. In 1940, he left Budapest for the United States and died there in 1945. ① 11세에 처음으로 대중 앞에서 연주했다. ② Royal Hungarian Academy of Music에서 공부했다. ③ 헝가리 민요를 대중화하려고 Zoltán Kodály와 협업했다. ④ 피아노 연주자로서 성공을 거두었다. ⑤ 1933년 이후 주로 독일에서 연주 활동을 했다. 27.

Here’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve. ① 더 나은 삶과 세상을 지향하는 사람과 사귀어야 한다. ② 부모는 자녀와 교우 관계에 대해 자주 대화해야 한다. ③ 우정을 지키려면 변함없는 신의를 보여줘야 한다. ④ 원만한 인간관계를 위해 이기적인 태도를 버려야 한다. ⑤ 가족의 의사결정은 모든 구성원의 합의로 이루어져야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 faulty storytelling 이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? In recent years I’ve come to see that, amazingly, the key to almost all of our problems is faulty storytelling, because it’s storytelling that drives the way we gather and spend our energy. I believe that stories ― not the ones people tell us but the ones we tell ourselves ― determine nothing less than our personal and professional destinies. And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best ― and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story ― the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t ― it shouldn’t and won’t ― be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary. After all, you’re not just the author of your story but also its main character, the hero. Heroes are never ordinary. * scrutinize: 면밀히 조사하다 ** paleontologist: 고생물학자 ① failing to live a self­determined life ② obsessing over the regrets of the past ③ not thinking we are the same as others ④ attributing someone else’s faults to ourselves ⑤ speaking ill of others by creating a false story 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? A question can be raised about the basic notion that sensitivity to problems is critical in setting the creative process in motion. It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to. ① 논리적 사고는 창의력 발휘를 저해한다. ② 필요는 창의성 발현을 위한 필수 조건이 아니다. ③ 다양한 경험이 반드시 발명에 유익한 것은 아니다. ④ 문제 해결 능력은 문제에 대한 민감성에서 비롯된다. ⑤ 창의적 산출물을 만들기 위해 지식의 축적이 필요하다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Pet owners sometimes tire of their animals or become overwhelmed by caring for a large number of pets or a difficult pet. Rather than face the stress of turning the pet in to a shelter, owners drive pets far from their home range and abandon them. Some people believe the animal has a better chance to survive roaming free than at a shelter, a false belief formed to salve the pet abandoner’s conscience. Releasing your pet, whether a cat, rabbit, or bearded dragon, is not the answer. Typically, people report roaming dogs for pickup by animal control authorities, who take the dog to the local shelter. Cats and exotic or unusual animals, unless confined to a small area, are not usually discovered or reported. Released pets not captured and sheltered suffer from weather, wild predators, and a lack of adequate food. Some pets die a difficult death. Other released pets survive and breed successfully. In these cases, the survivor pets become an invasive species and the environment suffers. * salve: (죄책감을) 덜다 ① struggles of wild animals to survive in nature ② importance of expanding shelters for released pets ③ why pet owners should not set unwanted pets free ④ how to prevent pet owners from abandoning their pets ⑤ conditions essential to maintaining pets’ physical health 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? The borderless­world thesis has been vigorously criticized by many geographers on the grounds that it presents a simplistic and idealized vision of globalization. It appears that the more territorial borders fall apart, the more various groups around the world cling to place, nation, and religion as markers of their identity. In other words, the reduction in capacity of territorial borders to separate and defend against others often elicits adverse reactions in numerous populations. Difference between people and places may be socially constructed through the erection of boundaries, but this does not mean that it is not deeply internalized by the members of a society.

So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best ― and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story ― the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t ― it shouldn’t and won’t ―be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary. After all, you’re not just the author of your story but also its main character, the hero. Heroes are never ordinary. * scrutinize: 면밀히 조사하다  ** paleontologist: 고생물학자  ① failing to live a self­determined life    ② obsessing over the regrets of the past  ③ not thinking we are the same as others  ④ attributing someone else’s faults to ourselves  ⑤ speaking ill of others by creating a false story"

It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to.   ① 논리적 사고는 창의력 발휘를 저해한다.    ② 필요는 창의성 발현을 위한 필수 조건이 아니다.  ③ 다양한 경험이 반드시 발명에 유익한 것은 아니다.   ④ 문제 해결 능력은 문제에 대한 민감성에서 비롯된다.   ⑤ 창의적 산출물을 만들기 위해 지식의 축적이 필요하다.

Rather than face the stress of turning the pet in to a shelter, owners drive pets far from their home range and abandon them. Some people believe the animal has a better chance to survive roaming free than at a shelter, a false belief formed to salve the pet abandoner’s conscience. Releasing your pet, whether a cat, rabbit, or bearded dragon, is not the answer. Typically, people report roaming dogs for pickup by animal control authorities, who take the dog to the local shelter. Cats and exotic or unusual animals, unless confined to a small area, are not usually discovered or reported. Released pets not captured and sheltered suffer from weather, wild predators, and a lack of adequate food. Some pets die a difficult death. Other released pets survive and breed successfully. In these cases, the survivor pets become an invasive species and the environment suffers.* salve: (죄책감을) 덜다  ① struggles of wild animals to survive in nature  ② importance of expanding shelters for released pets  ③ why pet owners should not set unwanted pets free   ④ how to prevent pet owners from abandoning their pets  ⑤ conditions essential to maintaining pets’ physical health"

The borderless­world thesis has been vigorously criticized by many geographers on the grounds that it presents a simplistic and idealized vision of globalization. It appears that the more territorial borders fall apart, the more various groups around the world cling to place, nation, and religion as markers of their identity. In other words, the reduction in capacity of territorial borders to separate and defend against others often elicits adverse reactions in numerous populations. Difference between people and places may be socially constructed through the erection of boundaries, but this does not mean that it is not deeply internalized by the members of a society.

From 1905, he began a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian Zoltán Kodály in trying to popularize Hungarian folk songs and gained a practical knowledge of string writing from both folk and classical musicians. Bartók had a successful career as a pianist, performing throughout Europe and in the United States with musicians such as the jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman. With the rise of fascism, he refused to play in Germany after 1933.

Both the acquisition and subsequent rejection of agriculture are becoming increasingly recognized as adaptive strategies to local conditions that may have occurred repeatedly over the past ten millennia. For example, in a recent study of the Mlabri, a modern hunter­gatherer group from northern Thailand, it was found that these people had previously been farmers, but had abandoned agriculture about 500 years ago. This raises the interesting question as to how many of the diminishing band of contemporary hunter­gatherer cultures are in fact the descendents of farmers who have only secondarily readopted hunter­gathering as a more useful lifestyle, perhaps after suffering from crop failures, dietary deficiencies, or climatic changes. Therefore, the process of what may be termed the ‘agriculturalization’ of human societies was , at least on a local level. Hunter­gatherer cultures across the world, from midwestern Amerindians to !Kung in the African Kalahari, have adopted and subsequently discarded agriculture, possibly on several occasions over their history, in response to factors such as game abundance, climatic change, and so on. * !Kung: !Kung족(族) ① not necessarily irreversible ② met with little resistance ③ essential for adaptation ④ started by pure coincidence ⑤ rarely subject to reconsideration 32. Sometimes it seems that contemporary art isn’t doing its job unless it provokes the question, ‘But is it art?’ I’m not sure the question is worth asking. It seems to me that the line between art and not­art is never going to be a sharp one. Worse, as the various art forms ― poetry, drama, sculpture, painting, fiction, dance, etc. ― are so different, I’m not sure why we should expect to be able to come up with . Art seems to be a paradigmatic example of a Wittgensteinian ‘family resemblance’ concept. Try to specify the necessary and sufficient condition for something qualifying as art and you’ll always find an exception to your criteria. If philosophy were to admit defeat in its search for some immutable essence of art, it is hardly through lack of trying. Arguably, we have very good reasons for thinking that this has been one of the biggest wild goose chases in the history of ideas. * paradigmatic: 전형적인 ** immutable: 변치 않는 ① a detailed guide to tracing the origin of art ② a novel way of perceiving reality through art ③ a single definition that can capture their variety ④ a genre that blends together diverse artistic styles ⑤ a radical idea that challenges the existing art forms 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. Rights imply obligations, but obligations need not imply rights. The obligations of parents to our children go way beyond their legal rights. Nor do the duties of rescue need to be matched by rights: we respond to a child drowning in a pond because of her plight, not her rights. A society that succeeds in generating many obligations can be more generous and harmonious than one relying only on rights. Obligations are to rights what taxation is to public spending ― the bit that is demanding. Western electorates have mostly learned that discussion of public spending must balance its benefits against how it would be financed. Otherwise, politicians promise higher spending during an election, and the post­election excess of spending over revenue is resolved by inflation. Just as new obligations are similar to extra revenue, so the creation of rights is similar to extra spending. The rights may well be appropriate, but this can only be determined by . * electorate: 유권자 ① an education about universal voting rights ② an expansion of the scope of private rights ③ a public discussion of the corresponding obligations ④ a consensus as to what constitutes a moral obligation ⑤ a reduction in the burden of complying with obligations 34. In the longer term, by bringing together enough data and enough computing power, the data­giants could hack the deepest secrets of life, and then use this knowledge not just to make choices for us or manipulate us, but also to re­engineer organic life and to create inorganic life forms. Selling advertisements may be necessary to sustain the giants in the short term, but they often evaluate apps, products and companies according to the data they harvest rather than according to the money they generate. A popular app may lack a business model and may even lose money in the short term, but as long as it sucks data, it could be worth billions. Even if you don’t know how to cash in on the data today, it is worth having it because it might hold the key to controlling and shaping life in the future. I don’t know for certain that the data­giants explicitly think about it in such terms, but their actions indicate that they . ① acknowledge the need for the democratization of data ② underestimate the long­term effects of short­term losses ③ treat data as a by­product of operations, not a valuable asset ④ focus only on the return they can make on selling advertisements ⑤ value the accumulation of data more than mere dollars and cents 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?

The reason why any sugar molecule ― whether in cocoa bean or pan or anywhere else ― turns brown when heated is to do with the presence of carbon.

In the 1980s and ’90s, some conservationists predicted that orangutans would go extinct in the wild within 20 or 30 years. Fortunately that didn’t happen. Many thousands more orangutans are now known to exist than were recognized at the turn of the millennium. (A) In fact, the overall population of orangutans has fallen by at least 80 percent in the past 75 years. It’s indicative of the difficulty of orangutan research that scientist Erik Meijaard is willing to say only that between 40,000 and 100,000 live on Borneo. Conservationists on Sumatra estimate that only 14,000 survive there. (B) This doesn’t mean that all is well in the orangutans’ world. The higher figures come thanks to improved survey methods and the discovery of previously unknown populations, not because the actual numbers have increased. (C) Much of this loss has been driven by habitat destruction from logging and the rapid spread of vast plantations of oil palm, the fruit of which is sold to make oil used in cooking and in many food products. ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",

The reason why any sugar molecule ― whether in cocoa bean or pan or anywhere else ― turns brown when heated is to do with the presence of carbon. (A) Further roasting will turn some of the sugar into pure carbon (double bonds all round), which creates a burnt flavor and a dark­brown color. Complete roasting results in charcoal: all of the sugar has become carbon, which is black. (B) On the whole, it is the carbon­rich molecules that are larger, so these get left behind, and within these there is a structure called a carbon­carbon double bond. This chemical structure absorbs light. In small amounts it gives the caramelizing sugar a yellow­brown color. (C) Sugars are carbohydrates, which is to say that they are made of carbon (“carbo­”), hydrogen (“hydr­”), and oxygen (“­ate”) atoms. When heated, these long molecules disintegrate into smaller units, some of which are so small that they evaporate (which accounts for the lovely smell). ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 고3 37. In the 1980s and ’90s, some conservationists predicted that orangutans would go extinct in the wild within 20 or 30 years. Fortunately that didn’t happen. Many thousands more orangutans are now known to exist than were recognized at the turn of the millennium. (A) In fact, the overall population of orangutans has fallen by at least 80 percent in the past 75 years. It’s indicative of the difficulty of orangutan research that scientist Erik Meijaard is willing to say only that between 40,000 and 100,000 live on Borneo. Conservationists on Sumatra estimate that only 14,000 survive there. (B) This doesn’t mean that all is well in the orangutans’ world. The higher figures come thanks to improved survey methods and the discovery of previously unknown populations, not because the actual numbers have increased. (C) Much of this loss has been driven by habitat destruction from logging and the rapid spread of vast plantations of oil palm, the fruit of which is sold to make oil used in cooking and in many food products. ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",
