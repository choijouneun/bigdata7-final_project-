Most of our staff have spent the last five days on call, without a break. I hope you will consider this matter. I look forward to your positive response.

Susan’s daughter Carrie is a special needs kid. She goes to a special school, special camp, special therapists. One day, out of the blue, she asked Susan if she could go get a slice of pizza on her own, not far from their apartment. Anxious, Susan said, “Well... why not get the pizza and bring it home to eat?” “No!” said Carrie, sixteen at the time. “Other people eat at the pizza place, and I want to, too!” Susan was concerned, but said okay, and Carrie went off by herself a block or two away. After a while, Carrie came back, grinning. “You made it! What made you want to do this?” Susan asked. Carrie had seen her friend Izzy on TV talking about his subway ride. “I thought if he could do it, I could do it too.” Susan’s heart swelled, realizing her daughter was braver and much more grown­up than she thought. ① indifferent → thrilled ② worried → proud ③ hopeful → regretful ④ ashamed → satisfied ⑤ surprised → disappointed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Leaving behind technology during intentional time alone is essential for the cognitive benefits, neurological repair, and spiritual clarity that are the gifts of solitude. Multiple studies show that anxiety is markedly reduced, and we gain benefits similar to solitude, not by simply turning our phones off but by having them not physically with us. If a phone is essential for safety during time alone, then turn off alerts, cover the screen — just tape paper right over it —and keep it somewhere that is terribly inconvenient to access. I am always surprised by how long it takes me to give up the impulse to reach for my phone, often for no reason at all, other than to “just check.” Check what? Always it is something that can do without me for the moment. It is important that we allow ourselves time to free our minds from even the possibility of constant connectivity, to “normalize deactivation,” as herbalist Sophia Rose puts it, allowing our overstimulated neuronal connections to rest and reassemble. ① 개 인 정 보 유 출 을 막 기 위 해 휴 대 전 화 보 안 을 강 화 해 야 한 다 . ② 물 리 적 고 립 상 황 에 대 응 하 기 위 한 통 신 기 술 을 개 발 해 야 한 다 . ③ 업 무 에 집 중 하 기 위 해 근 무 시 간 에 휴 대 전 화 사 용 을 자 제 해 야 한 다 . ④ 혼 자 있 는 시 간 의 이 점 을 얻 으 려 면 휴 대 전 화 와 떨 어 져 있 어 야 한 다 . ⑤ 고 독 감 을 느 끼 지 않 기 위 해 사 람 들 과 정 서 적 인 연 결 을 지 속 해 야 한 다 . 고3 21. 밑줄 친 production and marketing이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Humans already have a longer period of protected immaturity — a longer childhood — than any other species. Across species, a long childhood is correlated with an evolutionary strategy that depends on flexibility, intelligence, and learning. There is a developmental division of labor. Children get to learn freely about their particular environment without worrying about their own survival — caregivers look after that. Adults use what they learned as children to mate, hunt, and generally succeed as grown­ups in that environment. Children are the R&D (research and development) department of the human species. We grown­ups are production and marketing. We start out as brilliantly flexible but helpless and dependent babies, great at learning everything but terrible at doing just about anything. We end up as much less flexible but much more efficient and effective adults, not so good at learning but terrific at planning and acting. ① agents who conduct the tasks of living with what they learned ② executives who assign roles according to one’s characteristics ③ actors who realize their dreams by building better relations ④ traders who contribute to economic development ⑤ leaders who express their thoughts to others 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? In order to be successful and equitable, ecosystem management must be linked to poverty reduction. Urban infrastructure projects need to address the trade­offs between conservation, livelihoods, and equitable distribution of resources. Historically there has been tension when conservation models that create protected areas are perceived as inaccessible to communities. Often, these models are implemented at the expense of poor and marginalized residents and users of resources from the areas. Social, economic, and environmental development programs have become obstacles to sustainable development because there is no balance between the need to protect ecosystem services and the desire to use resources to address community needs. Communities need to be allowed to identify and negotiate their own options and to increase their flexibility to cope with unexpected change. * equitable: 공평한 ① 무 분 별 한 도 시 개 발 은 사 회 적 양 극 화 를 심 화 한 다 . ② 도 시 기 반 시 설 확 충 시 안 정 적 인 재 정 지 원 이 중 요 하 다 . ③ 인 근 지 역 간 의 긴 밀 한 협 력 은 생 태 계 보 존 의 기 반 이 된 다 . ④ 자 원 의 순 환 과 공 정 한 배 분 은 지 속 가 능 한 발 전 의 필 수 조 건 이 다 . ⑤ 생 태 계 관 리 시 빈 곤 층 을 포 함 한 지 역 사 회 의 요 구 를 고 려 할 필 요 가 있 다 . 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? For those of any age with an existing network of friendships built up in the three­dimensional world, social networking sites can be a happy extension of communication, along with email, video calls, or phone calls, when face­to­face time together just isn’t possible. The danger comes when a fake identity is both tempting and possible through relationships that are not based on real, three­dimensional interaction, and/or when the most important things in your life are the secondhand lives of others rather than personal experiences. Living in the context of the screen might suggest false norms of desirable lifestyles full of friends and parties. As ordinary human beings follow the activities of these golden individuals, self­esteem will inevitably drop; yet the constant narcissistic obsession with the self and its inadequacies will dominate. We can imagine a vicious circle where the more your identity is harmed as a result of social networking and the more inadequate you feel, the greater the appeal of a medium where you don’t need to communicate with people face­to­face. * narcissistic: 자아도취적인 ① negative effects of social networking services on self­perception ② unknown risks to personal well­being from internet addiction ③ software features to make virtual lives more realistic ④ efforts to increase face­to­face interaction for social bonds ⑤ difficulties of filtering out fake information on social media 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Melody is one of the primary ways that our expectations are controlled by composers. Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping­off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap. * adjacent: 인접한 ① How Awesome Repetition in Melody Can Be! ② Why a Big Leap Melody Tends to Go Back Home ③ Lyrics of Songs: Key Controller of Our Emotions ④ Should Composers Consider Their Potential Audience? ⑤ Misunderstanding of Composers’ Intention with Melody 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Anna May Wong에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Anna May Wong is considered the first Chinese­American movie star in Hollywood. She dropped out of high school to pursue a full­time acting career and, at 17, she played her first leading role in The Toll of the Sea. Reviewers praised her extraordinary acting but her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from casting her as a leading lady. Frustrated, Wong left for Europe in 1928, where she had main roles in many notable films. When American studios wanted fresh European talent in the 1930s, Wong’s new prestige immediately led to a main role on Broadway. She returned to America and used her influence to advocate for better film opportunities for Chinese­Americans. In 1938, she sold her movie costumes and donated the money from the sale to organizations supporting Chinese refugees. During World War II, she gave political speeches against the anti­Asian attitudes in the U.S. In 2022, she became the first Asian American to appear on U.S. currency ― a century after she landed her first leading role. ① 전업 배우가 되기 위해 고등학교를 중퇴했다. ② 유럽에서는 영화에 출연하지 못했다. ③ 자신의 영화 의상 판매 수입금을 기부했다. ④ 반아시아적 태도에 대항하는 연설을 했다. ⑤ 미국 화폐에 등장한 최초의 아시아계 미국인이 되었다. 27.

The intelligence of monkeys pales in comparison with that of our closest relatives, the great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos, whose brains are twice as ①large relative to their body weight. Most primatologists believe the apes acquired their larger brains to help them communicate with and ②manipulate their peers. And they certainly do exhibit complex social interactions within their group; they seem capable of feeling empathy, have a self­image, and exhibit a degree of consciousness as they can recognize ③themselves in a mirror. But this “social hypothesis” does not explain why it was the great apes that became so clever, rather than monkeys or a group of terrestrial mammals. Nor does it explain why orangutans, who seldom encounter their neighbors, ④being so intelligent. It seems likely that some other factor must have been in play ⑤that caused apes to become more intelligent in the first place, and which could subsequently have enabled some members of the group to develop high­level sociality. * primatologist: 영장류 동물학자 ** terrestrial: 육상의 30. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? The consequences of the mechanical breakdown of food by cooking are profound. Both the stiffness and toughness of the food is drastically reduced, making mechanical processing far ①easier. The forces your teeth need to apply to break up the food are lower, and the food ②releases its cell contents far more easily. The optimal tooth shape for breaking up the food also ③changes. Rather than needing thick, flat plates that can apply large compression forces to grind up tough materials and crush hard ones, it is better to have molars with pointed ends to cut through the softer food. It loosens at much ④higher forces and breaks up far more quickly. Modern hunter­gatherers spend far less time chewing their food even than apes that eat relatively soft fruit; they chew for less than an hour a day compared with five or six hours for chimpanzees.

Susan’s daughter Carrie is a special needs kid. She goes to a special school, special camp, special therapists. One day, out of the blue, she asked Susan if she could go get a slice of pizza on her own, not far from their apartment. Anxious, Susan said, “Well... why not get the pizza and bring it home to eat?” “No!” said Carrie, sixteen at the time. “Other people eat at the pizza place, and I want to, too!” Susan was concerned, but said okay, and Carrie went off by herself a block or two away. After a while, Carrie came back, grinning. “You made it! What made you want to do this?” Susan asked. Carrie had seen her friend Izzy on TV talking about his subway ride. “I thought if he could do it, I could do it too.” Susan’s heart swelled, realizing her daughter was braver and much more grown­up than she thought. ① indifferent → thrilled ② worried → proud ③ hopeful → regretful ④ ashamed → satisfied ⑤ surprised → disappointed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Leaving behind technology during intentional time alone is essential for the cognitive benefits, neurological repair, and spiritual clarity that are the gifts of solitude. Multiple studies show that anxiety is markedly reduced, and we gain benefits similar to solitude, not by simply turning our phones off but by having them not physically with us. If a phone is essential for safety during time alone, then turn off alerts, cover the screen — just tape paper right over it —and keep it somewhere that is terribly inconvenient to access. I am always surprised by how long it takes me to give up the impulse to reach for my phone, often for no reason at all, other than to “just check.” Check what? Always it is something that can do without me for the moment. It is important that we allow ourselves time to free our minds from even the possibility of constant connectivity, to “normalize deactivation,” as herbalist Sophia Rose puts it, allowing our overstimulated neuronal connections to rest and reassemble. ① 개 인 정 보 유 출 을 막 기 위 해 휴 대 전 화 보 안 을 강 화 해 야 한 다 . ② 물 리 적 고 립 상 황 에 대 응 하 기 위 한 통 신 기 술 을 개 발 해 야 한 다 . ③ 업 무 에 집 중 하 기 위 해 근 무 시 간 에 휴 대 전 화 사 용 을 자 제 해 야 한 다 . ④ 혼 자 있 는 시 간 의 이 점 을 얻 으 려 면 휴 대 전 화 와 떨 어 져 있 어 야 한 다 . ⑤ 고 독 감 을 느 끼 지 않 기 위 해 사 람 들 과 정 서 적 인 연 결 을 지 속 해 야 한 다 . 고3 21. 밑줄 친 production and marketing이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Humans already have a longer period of protected immaturity — a longer childhood — than any other species. Across species, a long childhood is correlated with an evolutionary strategy that depends on flexibility, intelligence, and learning. There is a developmental division of labor. Children get to learn freely about their particular environment without worrying about their own survival — caregivers look after that. Adults use what they learned as children to mate, hunt, and generally succeed as grown­ups in that environment. Children are the R&D (research and development) department of the human species. We grown­ups are production and marketing. We start out as brilliantly flexible but helpless and dependent babies, great at learning everything but terrible at doing just about anything. We end up as much less flexible but much more efficient and effective adults, not so good at learning but terrific at planning and acting. ① agents who conduct the tasks of living with what they learned ② executives who assign roles according to one’s characteristics ③ actors who realize their dreams by building better relations ④ traders who contribute to economic development ⑤ leaders who express their thoughts to others 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? In order to be successful and equitable, ecosystem management must be linked to poverty reduction. Urban infrastructure projects need to address the trade­offs between conservation, livelihoods, and equitable distribution of resources. Historically there has been tension when conservation models that create protected areas are perceived as inaccessible to communities. Often, these models are implemented at the expense of poor and marginalized residents and users of resources from the areas. Social, economic, and environmental development programs have become obstacles to sustainable development because there is no balance between the need to protect ecosystem services and the desire to use resources to address community needs. Communities need to be allowed to identify and negotiate their own options and to increase their flexibility to cope with unexpected change. * equitable: 공평한 ① 무 분 별 한 도 시 개 발 은 사 회 적 양 극 화 를 심 화 한 다 . ② 도 시 기 반 시 설 확 충 시 안 정 적 인 재 정 지 원 이 중 요 하 다 . ③ 인 근 지 역 간 의 긴 밀 한 협 력 은 생 태 계 보 존 의 기 반 이 된 다 . ④ 자 원 의 순 환 과 공 정 한 배 분 은 지 속 가 능 한 발 전 의 필 수 조 건 이 다 . ⑤ 생 태 계 관 리 시 빈 곤 층 을 포 함 한 지 역 사 회 의 요 구 를 고 려 할 필 요 가 있 다 . 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? For those of any age with an existing network of friendships built up in the three­dimensional world, social networking sites can be a happy extension of communication, along with email, video calls, or phone calls, when face­to­face time together just isn’t possible. The danger comes when a fake identity is both tempting and possible through relationships that are not based on real, three­dimensional interaction, and/or when the most important things in your life are the secondhand lives of others rather than personal experiences. Living in the context of the screen might suggest false norms of desirable lifestyles full of friends and parties. As ordinary human beings follow the activities of these golden individuals, self­esteem will inevitably drop; yet the constant narcissistic obsession with the self and its inadequacies will dominate. We can imagine a vicious circle where the more your identity is harmed as a result of social networking and the more inadequate you feel, the greater the appeal of a medium where you don’t need to communicate with people face­to­face. * narcissistic: 자아도취적인 ① negative effects of social networking services on self­perception ② unknown risks to personal well­being from internet addiction ③ software features to make virtual lives more realistic ④ efforts to increase face­to­face interaction for social bonds ⑤ difficulties of filtering out fake information on social media 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Melody is one of the primary ways that our expectations are controlled by composers. Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping­off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap. * adjacent: 인접한 ① How Awesome Repetition in Melody Can Be! ② Why a Big Leap Melody Tends to Go Back Home ③ Lyrics of Songs: Key Controller of Our Emotions ④ Should Composers Consider Their Potential Audience? ⑤ Misunderstanding of Composers’ Intention with Melody 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Urban infrastructure projects need to address the trade­offs between conservation, livelihoods, and equitable distribution of resources. Historically there has been tension when conservation models that create protected areas are perceived as inaccessible to communities. Often, these models are implemented at the expense of poor and marginalized residents and users of resources from the areas. Social, economic, and environmental development programs have become obstacles to sustainable development because there is no balance between the need to protect ecosystem services and the desire to use resources to address community needs. Communities need to be allowed to identify and negotiate their own options and to increase their flexibility to cope with unexpected change.* equitable: 공평한   ① 무분별한 도시 개발은 사회적 양극화를 심화한다.   ② 도시 기반 시설 확충 시 안정적인 재정 지원이 중요하다.  ③ 인근 지역 간의 긴밀한 협력은 생태계 보존의 기반이 된다.  ④ 자원의 순환과 공정한 배분은 지속가능한 발전의 필수조건이다.   ⑤ 생태계 관리 시 빈곤층을 포함한 지역사회의 요구를 고려할 필요가 있다.

[3점]    For those of any age with an existing network of friendships built up in the three­dimensional world, social networking sites can be a happy extension of communication, along with email, video calls, or phone calls, when face­to­face time together just isn’t possible. The danger comes when a fake identity is both tempting and possible through relationships that are not based on real, three­dimensional interaction, and/or when the most important things in your life are the secondhand lives of others rather than personal experiences. Living in the context of the screen might suggest false norms of desirable lifestyles full of friends and parties. As ordinary human beings follow the activities of these golden individuals, self­esteem will inevitably drop; yet the constant narcissistic obsession with the self and its inadequacies will dominate. We can imagine a vicious circle where the more your identity is harmed as a result of social networking and the more inadequate you feel, the greater the appeal of a medium where you don’t need to communicate with people face­to­face.* narcissistic: 자아도취적인  ① negative effects of social networking services on self­perception  ② unknown risks to personal well­being from internet addiction   ③ software features to make virtual lives more realistic  ④ efforts to increase face­to­face interaction for social bonds  ⑤ difficulties of filtering out fake information on social media"

Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping­off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap. * adjacent: 인접한  ① How Awesome Repetition in Melody Can Be!  ② Why a Big Leap Melody Tends to Go Back Home  ③ Lyrics of Songs: Key Controller of Our Emotions  ④ Should Composers Consider Their Potential Audience?  ⑤ Misunderstanding of Composers’ Intention with Melody4영어영역고348"

She dropped out of high school to pursue a full­time acting career and, at 17, she played her first leading role in The Toll of the Sea. Reviewers praised her extraordinary acting but her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from casting her as a leading lady. Frustrated, Wong left for Europe in 1928, where she had main roles in many notable films. When American studios wanted fresh European talent in the 1930s, Wong’s new prestige immediately led to a main role on Broadway. She returned to America and used her influence to advocate for better film opportunities for Chinese­Americans. In 1938, she sold her movie costumes and donated the money from the sale to organizations supporting Chinese refugees. During World War II, she gave political speeches against the anti­Asian attitudes in the U.S. In 2022, she became the first Asian American to appear on U.S. currency ― a century after she landed her first leading role.  ① 전업 배우가 되기 위해 고등학교를 중퇴했다.  ② 유럽에서는 영화에 출연하지 못했다.   ③ 자신의 영화 의상 판매 수입금을 기부했다.  ④ 반아시아적 태도에 대항하는 연설을 했다.   ⑤ 미국 화폐에 등장한 최초의 아시아계 미국인이 되었다."

A commonality between conceptual and computer art was . Conceptual artists decoupled the relationship between the art object and artist by mitigating all personal signs of invention. The artist became detached from the idea of personalized draftsmanship by installing a predetermined system ― a type of instruction for another to follow. That way there was, as Sol LeWitt states, no “dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.” Effectively any person could carry out the instructions. The same process was at work in computer art, where artists devised a predetermined drawing algorithm for the computer automaton to carry out the instruction. The human agent initiated the conceptual form, and a machine actuated it. Likewise, the computer artwork lacked any autographic mark, trace of spontaneity, or artistic authenticity. The plotter arm would replace the human arm in the production process. * mitigate: 완화하다 ** actuate: 작동시키다 *** plotter: 플로터(데이터를 도면화하는 출력 장치) ① the suppression of authorial presence ② the rejection of meaningless repetition ③ the elevation of ordinary objects to art ④ the preference of simplicity to elaboration ⑤ the tendency of artists to work in collaboration 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. Innate behaviors used for finding food, such as grazing, scavenging, or hunting, are more dependent on learning than behaviors used to consume food. Mating, nesting, eating, and prey­killing behaviors tend to be governed more by instinct. The greater dependence on learning to find food makes animals in the wild . Behaviors used to kill or consume food can be the same in any environment. Ernst Mayr, an evolutionary biologist, called these different behavioral systems “open” or “closed” to the effects of experience. A lion hunting her prey is an example of an open system. The hunting female lion recognizes her prey from a distance and approaches it carefully. Charles Herrick, a neurobiologist, wrote, “the details of the hunt vary every time she hunts. Therefore no combination of simple reflex arcs laid down in the nervous system will be adequate to meet the infinite variations of the requirements for obtaining food.” * scavenge: 동물의 사체를 찾아 다니다 ** reflex arc: 반사궁(충격이 통과하여 반사를 형성하는 신경 경로) ① less cooperative with others in their community ② less focused on monitoring predators’ approaches ③ more intelligent to build their natural surroundings ④ more sensitive to visual information than any other stimuli ⑤ more flexible and able to adapt to a variety of environments 34. The revolution’s victorious party can claim to have resolved the fundamental anomalies of the old paradigm and to have renewed the prospects for successful research governed by shared assumptions. Indeed, the new community typically rewrites the textbooks, and retells its own history, to reflect this point of view. But from the standpoint of the losers, or even of those who look on impartially, such rewritings might seem to mark change without any genuine claim to progress, because there is no neutral standard by which to assess the merits of the change. The resulting body of knowledge is in any case not cumulative, since much of what was previously known (or merely believed) had to be excluded without ever having been conclusively refuted. One likewise cannot plausibly talk about revolutionary reconstitutions of science as aiming toward truth, for similarly, there can be no . The available justification of scientific knowledge after revolutions, couched in new terms according to newly instituted standards, may well be sufficient, but perhaps only because these standards and terms are now inevitably our own. * anomaly: 변칙, 이례 ** refute: 반박하다 *** plausibly: 그럴듯하게 ① official connection between scientists and policy makers ② impartial formulation of standards for its assessment ③ incomplete terms to describe the reconstitutions ④ easy process to learn about new scientific theories ⑤ strong belief that scientific progress benefits everyone 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?

(A) For example, there are a variety of t­shirt and tea towel designs which celebrate the dangerous animals that can be encountered in Australia. This is a whimsical reconfiguration of the perceived threat that these animals pose to some tourists considering travel to this country. (B) The harmful effects of animals on tourism experiences has been the subject of analysis in a small number of studies, but deaths or injuries caused by animals to tourists are tiny in comparison to other causes such as drowning and vehicular accidents. (C) Nevertheless, the possibility that they might encounter a dangerous animal such as shark or snake or catch a disease such as malaria is sufficient to stop at least some tourists from visiting destinations where such threats exist. Sometimes this fear is turned into a marketing opportunity. * whimsical: 기발한 ** reconfiguration: 재구성 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 고3 37. In the course of acquiring a language, children are exposed to only a finite set of utterances. Yet they come to use and understand an infinite set of sentences. (A) Yet, they all arrive at pretty much the same grammar. The input that children get is haphazard in the sense that caretakers do not talk to their children to illustrate a particular point of grammar. Yet, all children develop systematic knowledge of a language. (B) Thus, despite the severe limitations and variation in the input children receive, and also in their personal circumstances, they all develop a rich and uniform system of linguistic knowledge. The knowledge attained goes beyond the input in various ways. (C) This has been referred to as the creative aspect of language use. This ‘creativity’ does not refer to the ability to write poetry or novels but rather the ability to produce and understand an unlimited set of new sentences never spoken or heard previously. The precise linguistic input children receive differs from child to child; no two children are exposed to exactly the same set of utterances. * haphazard: 무작위적인, 되는 대로의 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) Ignace Jan Paderewski, the famous composer­pianist, was scheduled to perform at a great concert hall in America. It was an evening to remember ― black tuxedos and long evening dresses, a high­society event. Present in the audience that evening was a mother with her nine­year­old son. Tired of waiting, (a) he squirmed constantly in his seat. His mother was in hopes that her son would be encouraged to practice the piano if he could just hear the great Paderewski at the keyboard. So, against his wishes, he had come. * squirm: 꼼지락대다 (B) The roar of the crowd became quiet as hundreds of frowning faces pointed in (b) his direction. Irritated and embarrassed, they began to shout: “Get that boy away from there!” “Who’d bring a kid that young in here?” “Where’s his mother?” “Stop (c) him!” Backstage, Paderewski overheard the sounds out front and quickly put together in his mind what was happening. Hurriedly, he grabbed his coat and rushed toward the stage. (C) As she turned to talk with friends, her son could stay seated no longer. (d) He slipped away from her side, strangely drawn to the black concert grand piano and its leather stool on the huge stage flooded with blinding lights. Without much notice from the sophisticated audience, the boy sat down at the piano stool, staring wide­eyed at the black and white keys. He placed his small, shaky fingers in the right location and began to play “Chopsticks.” (D) Without one word of announcement Paderewski bent over behind the boy, reached around both sides, began to improvise a countermelody to harmonize with and enhance “Chopsticks.” As the two of them played together, (e) he kept whispering in the boy’s ear: “Keep going. Don’t quit. Keep on playing... don’t stop... don’t quit.” Together, the old master and the little boy transformed an embarrassing situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was mesmerized. * improvise: 즉흥 연주하다 ** mesmerize: 매혹하다 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① 소년은 연주회에 오고 싶지 않았으나 오게 되었다. ② 짜증이 나고 당황한 관중은 크게 소리치기 시작했다. ③ Paderewski는 서둘러 무대로 달려갔다. ④ 소년은 무대 위 피아노 의자에 앉아 건반을 응시했다. ⑤ Paderewski는 짧은 공지 후 소년과 함께 연주했다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인 하시오.",
