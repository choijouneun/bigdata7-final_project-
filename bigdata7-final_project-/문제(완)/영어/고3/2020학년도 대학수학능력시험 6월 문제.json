The reviewer was harsh, calling it “an awful performance.” That raised in Sharon’s mind the question of whether it was worthwhile to go, but in the end, she reluctantly decided to attend the concert. The hall located in the old town was ancient and run-down. Looking around, Sharon again wondered what kind of show she could expect. But as soon as the tango started, everything changed. The piano, guitar, flute, and violin magically flew out in harmony. The audience cheered. “Oh my goodness! What fantastic music!” Sharon shouted. The rhythm and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her body and soul. The concert was far beyond her expectations.① excited →bored② doubtful →amazed③ calm→upset④ ashamed →grateful⑤ envious →indifferent "

Occasionally individuals do not merely come out as well as clearly state what is troubling them and instead select more indirect means of expressing their annoyance. One companion might talk to the various other in a way that is condescending and also indicates underlying hostility. Numerous other times, partners may mope and even frown without genuinely dealing with an issue. Companions may likewise merely prevent discussing an issue by swiftly switching over topics when the subject turns up or by being incredibly vague. Such indirect ways of expressing temper are not useful since they don’t provide the individual that is the target of the behaviors, an idea of exactly how to react. They understand their companion is irritated, but the absence of directness leaves them without advice regarding what they can do to solve the issue.* condescend: 거들먹거리다  ** mope: 울적해하다①이성보다 감정에 호소하여 상대방을 설득해야 한다.②상대방의 기분을 상하게 하는 행동을 자제해야 한다. ③문제 해결을 위해서는 문제를 직접적으로 언급해야 한다.④타인의 입장을 이해하려면 경청하는 자세를 가져야 한다.⑤목표 달성을 방해하는 문제점을 지속적으로 파악해야 한다.  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.338"

For example, retailers often boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or installation services. Think of a home goods retailer selling an unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its customer’s mission incomplete. When that retailer also sells assembly and delivery, it takes another step in the journey to the customer’s true mission of cooking in his backyard. Another example is the business-to-business service contracts that are layered on top of software sales. Maintenance, installation, training, delivery, anything at all that turns do-it-yourself into a do-it-for-me solution originally resulted from exploring the edge of where core products intersect with customer journeys.* ancillary: 보조의, 부차적인  ** intersect: 교차하다①requiring customers to purchase unnecessary goods②decreasing customers’ dependence on business services③focusing more on selling end products than components④adding a technological breakthrough to their core products⑤providing extra services beyond customers’ primary purchase"

When a definition emphasizes rules, competition, and high performance, many people will be excluded from participation or avoid other physical activities that are defined as “second class.” For example, when a 12-year-old is cut from an exclusive club soccer team, she may not want to play in the local league because she sees it as “recreational activity” rather than a real sport. This can create a situation in which most people are physically inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans ― a situation that negatively impacts health and increases health-care costs in a society or community. When sport is defined to include a wide range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and integrated into local expressions of social life, physical activity rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely.①운동선수의 기량은 경기 자체를 즐길 때 향상된다.②공정한 승부를 위해 합리적인 경기 규칙이 필요하다.③스포츠의 대중화는 스포츠 산업의 정의를 바꾸고 있다.④스포츠의 정의는 신체 활동 참여와 건강에 영향을 미친다.⑤활발한 여가 활동은 원만한 대인 관계 유지에 도움이 된다."

This is a critical activity because the frame you choose strongly influences your understanding of the problem, thereby conditioning your approach to solving it. For an illustration, consider Thibodeau and Broditsky’s series of experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime in a community. They found that the respondents’ suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast. People presented with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the problem, such as eliminating poverty and improving education. On the other hand, people presented with the beast metaphor focused on remediations: increasing the size of the police force and prisons. ①importance of asking the right questions for better solutions ②difficulty of using a metaphor to find solutions to a problem③reasons why problem framing prevents solutions from appearing④usefulness of preventive measures in reducing community crime⑤effect of problem framing on approaching and solving problems"

In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental threat. In the absence of threat, natural selection tends to resist change. It is un-biological to “explain” behavioural change as resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of domain-specific brain modules. Evolutionary psychologists surely know why brains evolved: as Cosmides and Tooby point out, brains are found only in animals that move. Brains are behavioural organs, and behavioural adaptation, being immediate and non-random, is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation. So, in animals with brains, behavioural change is the usual first response to environmental threat. If the change is successful, genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more gradually. Animals do not evolve carnivore teeth and then decide it might be a good idea to eat meat.* ex vacuo: 무(無)에서의  ** carnivore: 육식 동물①Which Adapts First, Behaviour or Genes?②The Brain Under Control of Selfish Genes③Why Animals Eat Meat: A Story of Survival④Genes Always Win the Battle Against Nature!⑤The Superior Efficiency of Genetic Adaptation448"

After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge University, he became interested in human behavior. He believed human behavior to be based on three abilities ―intellect, emotion, and will. Being a hardworking scholar, he held academic positions in several universities in England. He also wrote many books on psychology including the well-known Introduction to Social Psychology. In 1920, he published The Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human behavior. However, The Group Mind was poorly received when published. Somewhat disappointed, he moved to the United States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University. Seven years later, he moved to Duke University, where he developed a psychology department and continued various research. Today many people read his books, and psychologists celebrate his intellectual achievements.①Cambridge University에서 학위를 받았다. ②인간 행동이 세 가지 능력에 근거한다고 믿었다.③The Group Mind는 출판되었을 때 매우 인정받았다.④Duke University에서 다양한 연구를 계속하였다.⑤오늘날 심리학자들은 그의 지적 업적을 기린다."

Research with human runners challenged conventional wisdom and found that the ground-reaction forces at the foot and the shock transmitted up the leg and through the body after impact with the ground  as runners moved from extremely compliant to extremely hard running surfaces.

This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain. As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types.

Stressful events sometimes force people to develop new skills, reevaluate priorities, learn new insights, and acquire new strengths. (A) High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health, as expected, but people who had faced intermediate levels of adversity were healthier than those who experienced little adversity, suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can foster resilience. A follow-up study found a similar link between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects’ responses to laboratory stressors.(B) Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest resilience. Thus, having to deal with a moderate amount of stress may build resilience in the face of future stress. (C) In other words, the adaptation process initiated by stress can lead to personal changes for the better. One study that measured participants’ exposure to thirty-seven major negative events found a curvilinear relationship between lifetime adversity and mental health. * resilience: 회복력①(A) －(C) －(B)②(B) －(A) －(C)③(B) －(C) －(A)④(C) －(A) －(B)⑤(C) －(B) －(A)778"

        "text": "37.The fruit ripening process brings about the softening of cell walls, sweetening and the production of chemicals that give colour and flavour. The process is induced by the production of a plant hormone called ethylene. (A) If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with ethylene production or with the processes that respond to ethylene, fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe and full of flavour but would still be in good condition when it arrived at the supermarket shelf. (B) In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene before sale to the consumer to induce ripening. However, fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit picked ripe from the plant. Biotechnologists therefore saw an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening process in fruit.(C) The problem for growers and retailers is that ripening is followed sometimes quite rapidly by deterioration and decay and the product becomes worthless. Tomatoes and other fruits are, therefore, usually picked and transported when they are unripe.

Thus, we cannot assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or place means that more individuals were present at that time, or in that place. It may just be that the circumstances at one period of time, or at one location, were more favourable for fossilization than they were at other times, or in other places. Likewise, the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a particular time or place does not have the same implication as its presence. As the saying goes, ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. Similar logic suggests that taxa are likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil record, and they are likely to have survived beyond the time of their most recent appearance in the fossil record. Thus, the first appearance datum, and the last appearance datum of taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon.* subsequent: 다음의  ** hominin fossil: 인류 화석*** taxa: taxon(분류군)의 복수형󰀻Since fossilization and fossil discovery are affected by (A) conditions, the fossil evidence of a taxon cannot definitely (B) its population size or the times of its appearance and extinction.(A)(B)(A)(B)①experimental ……confirm②experimental ……reveal③environmental……clarify④environmental……conceal ⑤accidental……mask888[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.In many mountain regions, rights of access to water are associated with the possession of land ― until recently in the Andes, for example, land and water rights were (a) combined so water rights were transferred with the land.
