To whom it may concern, Thank you very much for faithfully responding to our request six months ago and taking corresponding measures. Even after the installation of road traffic safety facilities, we still need more for the safety of our students. It is a problem with the school road, which students use on their way to and from school. The width of the current school road is barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. So, there are risks of collision with vehicles on the road where students walk and accidents if many students flock to the narrow school road. Therefore, we ask you to expand the school road for students’ safety. I would appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible.

One night a buddy and I decided we were going to go find that Big Foot. We were in my old truck and we set off across the fields heading toward the tallest hill. The fields were rough, with only the slightest trail to follow. Along the way there were small trenches dug in the fields. I never figured out why. As we got closer and closer to the top of the hill, I was actually becoming scared, which was kind of rare, because at that age I was pretty fearless. As we got to the top of the hill, there was a loud thump! My truck sunk down like something heavy had just jumped in the bed. We were too terrified to look in the back. I panicked and decided to throw the truck into reverse and back down the hill. As I did so, there was another thump and a loud roar now came out like I’d never, ever heard before. ① relieved and relaxed ② pleased and delighted ③ bored and indifferent ④ alarmed and frightened ⑤ dissatisfied and angry 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Placing value on and investing in experiences provides us with a greater sense of vitality. Our experiences make us feel alive and give us greater opportunities to grow. Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me? Will the joy be temporary or long­lasting? Will the purchase be something I can share with others? If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short­term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer­term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount. Maybe you’d enjoy a concert with friends or a dinner cruise during the summer. Once you think of an experience you’d enjoy, seriously consider diverting the money for the purchase from possession to experience. ① 소유보다 경험에 가치를 두고 소비해야 한다. ② 물품 구매 시 품질을 우선으로 고려해야 한다. ③ 경제 흐름을 분석한 후 투자 대상을 선정해야 한다. ④ 단기 목표를 설정하여 잦은 성취 경험을 가져야 한다. ⑤ 경험하지 않은 것에 대해 섣불리 옳고 그름을 판단해서는 안 된다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? It seemed like a fair deal: we would accept new technologies, which would modify our habits and oblige us to adjust to certain changes, but in exchange we would be granted relief from the burden of work, more security, and above all, the freedom to pursue our desires. The sacrifice was worth the gain; there would be no regrets. Yet it has become apparent that this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse. Its swelling flanks hid the impositions of a new type of enslavement. The automatons are not as autonomous as advertised. They need us. Those computers that were supposed to do our calculations for us instead demand our attention: for ten hours a day, we are glued to their screens. Our communications monopolize our time. Time itself is accelerating. The complexity of the system overwhelms us. And leisure is often a costly distraction. * flank: 측면, 옆구리 ** automaton: 자동 장치 ① Doing leisure activities increased com m unication betw een colleagues. ②Labor was easily incorporated with leisure by the media. ③ People’s privacy was attacked because of low security. ④ Technology’s promise for leisure actually made people less free. ⑤Technological innovations did not im prove hierarchical w orking culture. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Giving honest information may be particularly relevant to integrity because honesty is so fundamental in discussions of trustworthiness. Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior. ① 조직이 처할 위기를 예측하여 사전 대책 수립이 필요하다. ② 리더는 업무 효율 향상을 위해 구성원의 사기를 높여야 한다. ③ 조직에 대한 과도한 헌신을 강조하는 것은 역효과를 초래한다. ④ 리더는 구성원의 비판적 의견을 수용하는 자세를 가져야 한다. ⑤ 리더는 조직 내 신뢰 유지를 위해 구성원에게 진실을 알려야 한다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? From your brain’s perspective, your body is just another source of sensory input. Sensations from your heart and lungs, your metabolism, your changing temperature, and so on, are like ambiguous blobs. These purely physical sensations inside your body have no objective psychological meaning. Once your concepts enter the picture, however, those sensations may take on additional meaning. If you feel an ache in your stomach while sitting at the dinner table, you might experience it as hunger. If flu season is just around the corner, you might experience that same ache as nausea. If you are a judge in a courtroom, you might experience the ache as a gut feeling that the defendant cannot be trusted. In a given moment, in a given context, your brain uses concepts to give meaning to internal sensations as well as to external sensations from the world, all simultaneously. From an aching stomach, your brain constructs an instance of hunger, nausea, or mistrust. * blob: 형태가 뚜렷하지 않은 것 ① influence of mental health on physical performance ② physiological responses to extreme emotional stimuli ③ role of negative emotions in dealing with difficult situations ④ necessity of staying objective in various professional contexts ⑤ brain’s interpretation of bodily sensations using concepts in context 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? On an antelope’s skull, the eye sockets are situated on the side of the head. This is because this animal spends a lot of its time with its head bent down to eat a low‑nutrient food: grass. While the animal is busy grazing, there will be predators out stalking for their food, so the antelope needs the greatest possible range of vision so that it has the maximum chance of seeing its predator and making an escape. With the eye sockets at the back of the head and on the side, it can see nearly 360° around itself. The eye of the antelope is also at the back of its head, giving it a long nose. If the eyes were at the front of the skull, vision would be obscured by long grass, so its long nose also gives an evolutionary advantage. ① Better Predator Detection: Eyes’ Location Matters! ② Escaping as a Primary Defense Tactic in a Field ③ Closer Eyes, Less Accurate Distance Perception ④ A Win‑Win Survival Strategy for Prey and Predator ⑤ Why Do Animals Have Longer Noses than Humans? 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Eric Carle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Eric Carle was an American writer and illustrator of children’s literature. Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, he moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old. He was educated there, and graduated from an art school in Stuttgart, Germany. He moved back to the United States and worked as a graphic designer at The New York Times. In the mid­1960s, children’s author Bill Martin Jr. asked Carle to illustrate a book he was writing. In 1967, they published their first collaboration: Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? His best­known work, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has been translated into more than 66 languages and sold over 50 million copies. In 2002, Carle and his wife opened the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, which collects and features the work of children’s book illustrators from around the world. ① 독일에서 예술 학교를 졸업했다. ② The New York Times에서 그래픽 디자이너로 일했다. ③ 1960년대 초반에 Bill Martin Jr.와의 첫 합작품을 출판했다. ④ The Very Hungry Caterpillar는 66개가 넘는 언어로 번역되었다. ⑤ 아내와 Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art를 개관했다. 27.

To whom it may concern, Thank you very much for faithfully responding to our request six months ago and taking corresponding measures. Even after the installation of road traffic safety facilities, we still need more for the safety of our students. It is a problem with the school road, which students use on their way to and from school. The width of the current school road is barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. So, there are risks of collision with vehicles on the road where students walk and accidents if many students flock to the narrow school road. Therefore, we ask you to expand the school road for students’ safety. I would appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible.

One night a buddy and I decided we were going to go find that Big Foot. We were in my old truck and we set off across the fields heading toward the tallest hill. The fields were rough, with only the slightest trail to follow. Along the way there were small trenches dug in the fields. I never figured out why. As we got closer and closer to the top of the hill, I was actually becoming scared, which was kind of rare, because at that age I was pretty fearless. As we got to the top of the hill, there was a loud thump! My truck sunk down like something heavy had just jumped in the bed. We were too terrified to look in the back. I panicked and decided to throw the truck into reverse and back down the hill. As I did so, there was another thump and a loud roar now came out like I’d never, ever heard before. ① relieved and relaxed ② pleased and delighted ③ bored and indifferent ④ alarmed and frightened ⑤ dissatisfied and angry 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Placing value on and investing in experiences provides us with a greater sense of vitality. Our experiences make us feel alive and give us greater opportunities to grow. Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me? Will the joy be temporary or long­lasting? Will the purchase be something I can share with others? If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short­term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer­term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount. Maybe you’d enjoy a concert with friends or a dinner cruise during the summer. Once you think of an experience you’d enjoy, seriously consider diverting the money for the purchase from possession to experience. ① 소유보다 경험에 가치를 두고 소비해야 한다. ② 물품 구매 시 품질을 우선으로 고려해야 한다. ③ 경제 흐름을 분석한 후 투자 대상을 선정해야 한다. ④ 단기 목표를 설정하여 잦은 성취 경험을 가져야 한다. ⑤ 경험하지 않은 것에 대해 섣불리 옳고 그름을 판단해서는 안 된다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? It seemed like a fair deal: we would accept new technologies, which would modify our habits and oblige us to adjust to certain changes, but in exchange we would be granted relief from the burden of work, more security, and above all, the freedom to pursue our desires. The sacrifice was worth the gain; there would be no regrets. Yet it has become apparent that this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse. Its swelling flanks hid the impositions of a new type of enslavement. The automatons are not as autonomous as advertised. They need us. Those computers that were supposed to do our calculations for us instead demand our attention: for ten hours a day, we are glued to their screens. Our communications monopolize our time. Time itself is accelerating. The complexity of the system overwhelms us. And leisure is often a costly distraction. * flank: 측면, 옆구리 ** automaton: 자동 장치 ① Doing leisure activities increased com m unication betw een colleagues. ②Labor was easily incorporated with leisure by the media. ③ People’s privacy was attacked because of low security. ④ Technology’s promise for leisure actually made people less free. ⑤Technological innovations did not im prove hierarchical w orking culture. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Giving honest information may be particularly relevant to integrity because honesty is so fundamental in discussions of trustworthiness. Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior. ① 조직이 처할 위기를 예측하여 사전 대책 수립이 필요하다. ② 리더는 업무 효율 향상을 위해 구성원의 사기를 높여야 한다. ③ 조직에 대한 과도한 헌신을 강조하는 것은 역효과를 초래한다. ④ 리더는 구성원의 비판적 의견을 수용하는 자세를 가져야 한다. ⑤ 리더는 조직 내 신뢰 유지를 위해 구성원에게 진실을 알려야 한다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? From your brain’s perspective, your body is just another source of sensory input. Sensations from your heart and lungs, your metabolism, your changing temperature, and so on, are like ambiguous blobs. These purely physical sensations inside your body have no objective psychological meaning. Once your concepts enter the picture, however, those sensations may take on additional meaning. If you feel an ache in your stomach while sitting at the dinner table, you might experience it as hunger. If flu season is just around the corner, you might experience that same ache as nausea. If you are a judge in a courtroom, you might experience the ache as a gut feeling that the defendant cannot be trusted. In a given moment, in a given context, your brain uses concepts to give meaning to internal sensations as well as to external sensations from the world, all simultaneously. From an aching stomach, your brain constructs an instance of hunger, nausea, or mistrust. * blob: 형태가 뚜렷하지 않은 것 ① influence of mental health on physical performance ② physiological responses to extreme emotional stimuli ③ role of negative emotions in dealing with difficult situations ④ necessity of staying objective in various professional contexts ⑤ brain’s interpretation of bodily sensations using concepts in context 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?

[3점]    It seemed like a fair deal: we would accept new technologies, which would modify our habits and oblige us to adjust to certain changes, but in exchange we would be granted relief from the burden of work, more security, and above all, the freedom to pursue our desires. The sacrifice was worth the gain; there would be no regrets. Yet it has become apparent that this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse. Its swelling flanks hid the impositions of a new type of enslavement. The automatons are not as autonomous as advertised. They need us. Those computers that were supposed to do our calculations for us instead demand our attention: for ten hours a day, we are glued to their screens. Our communications monopolize our time. Time itself is accelerating. The complexity of the system overwhelms us. And leisure is often a costly distraction. * flank: 측면, 옆구리  ** automaton: 자동 장치   ① Doing leisure activities increased communication between colleagues.  ②Labor was easily incorporated with leisure by the media.  ③ People’s privacy was attacked because of low security.  ④ Technology’s promise for leisure actually made people less free.  ⑤Technological innovations did not improve hierarchical working culture.

Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior.  ① 조직이 처할 위기를 예측하여 사전 대책 수립이 필요하다.  ② 리더는 업무 효율 향상을 위해 구성원의 사기를 높여야 한다.  ③ 조직에 대한 과도한 헌신을 강조하는 것은 역효과를 초래한다.  ④ 리더는 구성원의 비판적 의견을 수용하는 자세를 가져야 한다.  ⑤ 리더는 조직 내 신뢰 유지를 위해 구성원에게 진실을 알려야 한다."

Sensations from your heart and lungs, your metabolism, your changing temperature, and so on, are like ambiguous blobs.

If you are a judge in a courtroom, you might experience the ache as a gut feeling that the defendant cannot be trusted.

Infants’ preference for looking at new things is so strong that psychologists began to realize that they could use it as a test of infants’ visual discrimination, and even their memory. Could an infant tell the difference between two similar images? Between two similar shades of the same color? Could an infant recall having seen something an hour, a day, a week ago? held the answer. If the infant’s gaze lingered, it suggested that the infant could tell that a similar image was nonetheless different in some way. If the infant, after a week without seeing an image, didn’t look at it much when it was shown again, the infant must be able at some level to remember having seen it the week before. In most cases, the results revealed that infants were more cognitively capable earlier than had been previously assumed. The visual novelty drive became, indeed, one of the most powerful tools in psychologists’ toolkit, unlocking a host of deeper insights into the capacities of the infant mind. ① Memory distortion in infancy ② Undeveloped vision of newborns ③ The preference for social interaction ④ The inbuilt attraction to novel images ⑤ Infants’ communication skills with parents 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. Imagine there are two habitats, a rich one containing a lot of resources and a poor one containing few, and that there is no territoriality or fighting, so each individual is free to exploit the habitat in which it can achieve the higher pay­off, measured as rate of consumption of resource. With no competitors, an individual would simply go to the better of the two habitats and this is what we assume the first arrivals will do. But what about the later arrivals? As more competitors occupy the rich habitat, the resource will be depleted, and so less profitable for further newcomers. Eventually a point will be reached where the next arrivals will do better by occupying the poorer quality habitat where, although the resource is in shorter supply, there will be less competition. Thereafter, the two habitats should be filled so that the profitability for an individual is the same in each one. In other words, competitors should adjust their distribution in relation to habitat quality so that each individual . ① fails to find adequate resources in time ② invades the other habitat to get more resources ③ enjoys the same rate of acquisition of resources ④ needs to gather resources faster than newcomers ⑤ is more attracted to the rich habitat than the poor one 34.

Therefore, advocating action should lead to higher compliance than prohibiting action. (A) This is a prescription that is rife with danger, failing to provide an implementation rule and raising reactance. Much better is to say, “To help make sure that other people provide answers as useful as yours have been, when people ask you about this study, please tell them that you and another person answered some questions about each other.” (B) For example, researchers have a choice of how to debrief research participants in an experiment involving some deception or omission of information. Often researchers attempt to commit the participant to silence, saying “Please don’t tell other potential participants that feedback from the other person was false.” (C) Similarly, I once saw a delightful and unusual example of this principle at work in an art gallery. A fragile acrylic sculpture had a sign at the base saying, “Please touch with your eyes.” The command was clear, yet created much less reactance in me than “Don’t touch!” would have. * reactance: 저항 ** rife: 가득한 *** debrief: 비밀준수 의무를 지우다① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 고3 37.

This is why it is difficult to wake up from or scream out during a nightmare. Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. ( ①) REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement, a stage of sleep discovered by Professor Nathaniel Kleitman at the University of Chicago in 1958.

There is no question that losing weight is hard. According to one calculation, you must walk 35 miles or jog for seven hours to lose just one pound. One big problem with exercise is that we don’t track it very scrupulously. A study in America found that people overestimated the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off. As Daniel Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker — equivalent to more than sixty marathons. That’s pretty impressive, but here’s a reasonable question: how many factory workers look as if they run a marathon every six days? To be cruelly blunt, not many.

(A) As we cruised the tree‑canopied country road in our new car, my husband and I were savoring the unusual warmth of the early spring day until we passed an old farmhouse. “Did you see those ducks?” my husband asked. To which I replied, “Ducks? They were chickens!” “No, honey, (a) I am talking about the mama duck with the three ducklings!” “You mean the mama hen and the three chicks?” He retorted, “Honey, they were waddling with orange beaks!” “Oh, come on,” I said doubtfully. “They had yellow beaks with red crests.” (B) Not every disagreement is as easy to solve as our ducks‑and‑chickens experience. But to this day, my husband and I end many conflicts by agreeing to disagree. I’ll say, “It’s a chicken,” to which (b) he will reply, “It’s a duck.” Each of us is willing to compromise as we consider the different perspectives of the other and realize that both of us can be right.

Indeed, in the same yard, a mama duck and three ducklings were playing in the water by the side of the road and, up near the farmhouse, there was a mama hen pecking the ground with her three baby chicks following suit.
