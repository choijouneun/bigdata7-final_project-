Morganic Corporation, located in the heart of Arkansas, spent the past decade providing great organic crops at a competitive price, growing into the ninth leading organic farming operation in the country. As a seasoned writer with access to Richard Taylor, the founder and president of Morganic, I propose writing a profile piece on Taylor for your magazine. I believe the time has come to cover Morganic’s rise in the organic farming industry. The piece would run in the normal 800 - 1,200 word range with photographs available of Taylor and Morganic’s operation. Thank you for your consideration of this article.

Mark was participating in freestyle swimming competitions in this Olympics. He had a firm belief that he could get a medal in the 200m. Swimming was dominated by Americans at the time, so Mark was dreaming of becoming a national hero for his country, Britain. That day, Mark was competing in his very last race — the final round of the 200m. He had done his training and was ready. One minute and fifty seconds later, it was all over. He had tried hard and, at his best, was ranked number four. He fell short of a bronze medal by 0.49 of a second. And that was the end of Mark’s swimming career. He was heartbroken. He had nothing left. ① worried → hopeful ② grateful → fearful ③ pleased → jealous ④ indifferent → upset ⑤ confident → disappointed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? There is no denying that engaging in argument carries certain significant risks. When we argue, we exchange and examine reasons with a view toward believing what our best reasons say we should believe; sometimes we discover that our current reasons fall short, and that our beliefs are not well supported after all. Or sometimes we discover that a belief that we had dismissed as silly or obviously false in fact enjoys the support of highly compelling reasons. On other occasions, we discover that the reasons offered by those with whom we disagree measure up toe­to­toe with our own reasons. In any of these situations, an adjustment in our belief is called for; we must change what we believe, or revise it, or replace it, or suspend belief altogether. ① 논쟁 중에 알게 된 바에 따라 자신의 믿음을 조정해야 한다. ② 논쟁을 하기 전에 상대방의 주장을 면밀히 검토해야 한다. ③ 논쟁에서 불리해지더라도 감정적으로 반응해서는 안 된다. ④ 의사 결정 시에는 충분한 시간을 갖고 신중하게 해야 한다. ⑤ 반대 의견을 제시할 때 상대의 논리적 허점을 공략해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 live in the shadow of the future가 다음 글에서 의 미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Thanks to the power of reputation, we help others without expecting an immediate return. If, thanks to endless chat and intrigue, the world knows that you are a good, charitable guy, then you boost your chance of being helped by someone else at some future date. The converse is also the case. I am less likely to get my back scratched, in the form of a favor, if it becomes known that I never scratch anybody else’s. Indirect reciprocity now means something like “If I scratch your back, my good example will encourage others to do the same and, with luck, someone will scratch mine.” By the same token, our behavior is endlessly shaped by the possibility that somebody else might be watching us or might find out what we have done. We are often troubled by the thought of what others may think of our deeds. In this way, our actions have consequences that go far beyond any individual act of charity, or indeed any act of mean­spirited malice. We all behave differently when we know we live in the shadow of the future. That shadow is cast by our actions because there is always the possibility that others will find out what we have done. * malice: 악의 ① are distracted by inner conflict ② fall short of our own expectations ③ seriously compete regardless of the results ④ are under the influence of uncertainty ⑤ ultimately reap what we have sown 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? When you experience affect without knowing the cause, you are more likely to treat affect as information about the world, rather than your experience of the world. The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn’t sleep well last night, or maybe it’s just lunchtime. The change in her body budget, which she’s experiencing as affect, might not have anything to do with you. ①직감에 따른 판단이 더 좋은 결과로 이어지는 경우가 많다. ②외부적 환경이 우리의 감정과 판단에 미치는 영향은 크지 않다. ③우리는 자신도 모르게 감정의 영향을 받아서 현실을 판단한다. ④상대방의 반응이 평소와 다를 때에는 자신을 되돌아봐야 한다. ⑤상대방에 관한 배경지식을 통해 그 사람을 더 잘 이해하게 된다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Whenever possible, we should take measures to re­socialize the information we think about. The continual patter we carry on in our heads is in fact a kind of internalized conversation. Likewise, many of the written forms we encounter at school and at work — from exams and evaluations, to profiles and case studies, to essays and proposals — are really social exchanges (questions, stories, arguments) put on paper and addressed to some imagined listener or interlocutor. There are significant advantages to turning such interactions at a remove back into actual social encounters. Research demonstrates that the brain processes the “same” information differently, and often more effectively, when other human beings are involved — whether we’re imitating them, debating them, exchanging stories with them, synchronizing and cooperating with them, teaching or being taught by them. We are inherently social creatures, and our thinking benefits from bringing other people into our train of thought. * patter: 재잘거림 ** interlocutor: 대화자 *** at a remove: 조금 거리를 둔 ①importance of processing information via social interactions ②ways of improving social skills through physical activities ③necessity of regular evaluations of cognitive functions ④influence of personality traits on social interactions ⑤socialization as a form of internalized social control 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Every day an enormous amount of energy is created by the movement of people and animals, and by interactions of people with their immediate surroundings. This is usually in very small amounts or in very dispersed environments. Virtually all of that energy is lost to the local environment, and historically there have been no efforts to gather it. It may seem odd to consider finding ways to “collect” energy that is given off all around us — by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example — but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated — and often wasted — and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries. ① Energy Harvesting: Every Little Helps ② Burning Waste for Energy Is Harmful ③ Is Renewable Energy Really Green? ④ Pros and Cons of Energy Harvesting ⑤　Can Natural Energy Sources Fulfill the Demand? 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? US Adults’ Attitudes to Media Ads (surveyed in 2022) “How do you feel about advertisements on each of the following?” The above graph shows the US adults’ attitudes to media ads, based on a survey in 2022. ①In all the mediums surveyed, the percentages of respondents who enjoy or love media ads are higher than those of respondents who don’t enjoy or hate media ads. ②As for those who are indifferent to media ads, their percentages are the lowest in every medium except for print mediums. ③For respondents who don’t enjoy or hate media ads, their percentage in social media platforms is the highest, while that in websites the lowest. ④The percentage of respondents who are indifferent to media ads in websites is the same as that of those who have the same attitude to media ads in social media platforms. ⑤In print mediums, the percentage of respondents who are indifferent to media ads is more than twice that of those who don’t enjoy or hate media ads. 26. Georgy Gause에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Georgy Gause was born in Moscow, Russia. He was admitted to Moscow State University, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1931 and PhD in 1940. Prior to achieving his doctoral degree, Gause published his ecological classic, The Struggle for Existence, in 1934 (and in English!). This book and similar research papers in the 1930s helped lay the early foundation for population ecology and indeed fostered the introduction of mathematics into the historical development of ecology. In ecology, Gause’s contributions are equally acknowledged along with those of other early ecologists who studied population dynamics. However, most ecologists are not aware that Gause eventually went on to conduct very important research on antibiotics and somewhat left ecology behind. From 1960 until his death he was director of the institute of antibiotics he and his wife had founded. ① 1931년에 학사 학위를 받았다. ② 박사 학위 취득 전에 The Struggle for Existence를 출간했다. ③ 그의 책은 생태학의 역사적 발전에 수학의 도입을 촉진했다. ④ 그의 항생제 연구는 대부분의 생태학자에게 알려져 있다. ⑤ 아내와 항생제 연구소를 설립했다. 27.

Morganic Corporation, located in the heart of Arkansas, spent the past decade providing great organic crops at a competitive price, growing into the ninth leading organic farming operation in the country.

Mark was participating in freestyle swimming competitions in this Olympics. He had a firm belief that he could get a medal in the 200m. Swimming was dominated by Americans at the time, so Mark was dreaming of becoming a national hero for his country, Britain. That day, Mark was competing in his very last race — the final round of the 200m. He had done his training and was ready. One minute and fifty seconds later, it was all over. He had tried hard and, at his best, was ranked number four. He fell short of a bronze medal by 0.49 of a second. And that was the end of Mark’s swimming career. He was heartbroken. He had nothing left. ① worried → hopeful ② grateful → fearful ③ pleased → jealous ④ indifferent → upset ⑤ confident → disappointed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? There is no denying that engaging in argument carries certain significant risks. When we argue, we exchange and examine reasons with a view toward believing what our best reasons say we should believe; sometimes we discover that our current reasons fall short, and that our beliefs are not well supported after all. Or sometimes we discover that a belief that we had dismissed as silly or obviously false in fact enjoys the support of highly compelling reasons. On other occasions, we discover that the reasons offered by those with whom we disagree measure up toe­to­toe with our own reasons. In any of these situations, an adjustment in our belief is called for; we must change what we believe, or revise it, or replace it, or suspend belief altogether. ① 논쟁 중에 알게 된 바에 따라 자신의 믿음을 조정해야 한다. ② 논쟁을 하기 전에 상대방의 주장을 면밀히 검토해야 한다. ③ 논쟁에서 불리해지더라도 감정적으로 반응해서는 안 된다. ④ 의사 결정 시에는 충분한 시간을 갖고 신중하게 해야 한다. ⑤ 반대 의견을 제시할 때 상대의 논리적 허점을 공략해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 live in the shadow of the future가 다음 글에서 의 미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Thanks to the power of reputation, we help others without expecting an immediate return. If, thanks to endless chat and intrigue, the world knows that you are a good, charitable guy, then you boost your chance of being helped by someone else at some future date. The converse is also the case. I am less likely to get my back scratched, in the form of a favor, if it becomes known that I never scratch anybody else’s. Indirect reciprocity now means something like “If I scratch your back, my good example will encourage others to do the same and, with luck, someone will scratch mine.” By the same token, our behavior is endlessly shaped by the possibility that somebody else might be watching us or might find out what we have done. We are often troubled by the thought of what others may think of our deeds. In this way, our actions have consequences that go far beyond any individual act of charity, or indeed any act of mean­spirited malice. We all behave differently when we know we live in the shadow of the future. That shadow is cast by our actions because there is always the possibility that others will find out what we have done. * malice: 악의 ① are distracted by inner conflict ② fall short of our own expectations ③ seriously compete regardless of the results ④ are under the influence of uncertainty ⑤ ultimately reap what we have sown 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? When you experience affect without knowing the cause, you are more likely to treat affect as information about the world, rather than your experience of the world. The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn’t sleep well last night, or maybe it’s just lunchtime. The change in her body budget, which she’s experiencing as affect, might not have anything to do with you. ①직감에 따른 판단이 더 좋은 결과로 이어지는 경우가 많다. ②외부적 환경이 우리의 감정과 판단에 미치는 영향은 크지 않다. ③우리는 자신도 모르게 감정의 영향을 받아서 현실을 판단한다. ④상대방의 반응이 평소와 다를 때에는 자신을 되돌아봐야 한다. ⑤상대방에 관한 배경지식을 통해 그 사람을 더 잘 이해하게 된다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Whenever possible, we should take measures to re­socialize the information we think about. The continual patter we carry on in our heads is in fact a kind of internalized conversation. Likewise, many of the written forms we encounter at school and at work — from exams and evaluations, to profiles and case studies, to essays and proposals — are really social exchanges (questions, stories, arguments) put on paper and addressed to some imagined listener or interlocutor. There are significant advantages to turning such interactions at a remove back into actual social encounters. Research demonstrates that the brain processes the “same” information differently, and often more effectively, when other human beings are involved — whether we’re imitating them, debating them, exchanging stories with them, synchronizing and cooperating with them, teaching or being taught by them. We are inherently social creatures, and our thinking benefits from bringing other people into our train of thought. * patter: 재잘거림 ** interlocutor: 대화자 *** at a remove: 조금 거리를 둔 ①importance of processing information via social interactions ②ways of improving social skills through physical activities ③necessity of regular evaluations of cognitive functions ④influence of personality traits on social interactions ⑤socialization as a form of internalized social control 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Every day an enormous amount of energy is created by the movement of people and animals, and by interactions of people with their immediate surroundings. This is usually in very small amounts or in very dispersed environments. Virtually all of that energy is lost to the local environment, and historically there have been no efforts to gather it. It may seem odd to consider finding ways to “collect” energy that is given off all around us — by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example — but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated — and often wasted — and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries. ① Energy Harvesting: Every Little Helps ② Burning Waste for Energy Is Harmful ③ Is Renewable Energy Really Green? ④ Pros and Cons of Energy Harvesting ⑤　Can Natural Energy Sources Fulfill the Demand? 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

That shadow is cast by our actions because there is always the possibility that others will find out what we have done.* malice: 악의 ① are distracted by inner conflict② fall short of our own expectations③ seriously compete regardless of the results④ are under the influence of uncertainty⑤ ultimately reap what we have sown"

The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn’t sleep well last night, or maybe it’s just lunchtime. The change in her body budget, which she’s experiencing as affect, might not have anything to do with you.①직감에 따른 판단이 더 좋은 결과로 이어지는 경우가 많다.②외부적 환경이 우리의 감정과 판단에 미치는 영향은 크지 않다.③우리는 자신도 모르게 감정의 영향을 받아서 현실을 판단한다.④상대방의 반응이 평소와 다를 때에는 자신을 되돌아봐야 한다.⑤상대방에 관한 배경지식을 통해 그 사람을 더 잘 이해하게 된다."

The continual patter we carry on in our heads is in fact a kind of internalized conversation. Likewise, many of the written forms we encounter at school and at work — from exams and evaluations, to profiles and case studies, to essays and proposals — are really social exchanges (questions, stories, arguments) put on paper and addressed to some imagined listener or interlocutor. There are significant advantages to turning such interactions at a remove back into actual social encounters. Research demonstrates that the brain processes the “same” information differently, and often more effectively, when other human beings are involved — whether we’re imitating them, debating them, exchanging stories with them, synchronizing and cooperating with them, teaching or being taught by them. We are inherently social creatures, and our thinking benefits from bringing other people into our train of thought.* patter: 재잘거림  ** interlocutor: 대화자*** at a remove: 조금 거리를 둔①importance of processing information via social interactions②ways of improving social skills through physical activities③necessity of regular evaluations of cognitive functions④influence of personality traits on social interactions⑤socialization as a form of internalized social control"

This is usually in very small amounts or in very dispersed environments. Virtually all of that energy is lost to the local environment, and historically there have been no efforts to gather it. It may seem odd to consider finding ways to “collect” energy that is given off all around us — by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example — but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated — and often wasted —and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries.① Energy Harvesting: Every Little Helps② Burning Waste for Energy Is Harmful③ Is Renewable Energy Really Green?④ Pros and Cons of Energy Harvesting⑤　Can Natural Energy Sources Fulfill the Demand?4영어영역고348"

Prior to achieving his doctoral degree, Gause published his ecological classic, The Struggle for Existence, in 1934 (and in English!). This book and similar research papers in the 1930s helped lay the early foundation for population ecology and indeed fostered the introduction of mathematics into the historical development of ecology. In ecology, Gause’s contributions are equally acknowledged along with those of other early ecologists who studied population dynamics. However, most ecologists are not aware that Gause eventually went on to conduct very important research on antibiotics and somewhat left ecology behind. From 1960 until his death he was director of the institute of antibiotics he and his wife had founded.① 1931년에 학사 학위를 받았다.② 박사 학위 취득 전에 The Struggle for Existence를 출간했다.③ 그의 책은 생태학의 역사적 발전에 수학의 도입을 촉진했다.④ 그의 항생제 연구는 대부분의 생태학자에게 알려져 있다. ⑤ 아내와 항생제 연구소를 설립했다."

Lewis­Williams believes that the religious view of hunter groups was a contract between the hunter and the hunted. ‘The powers of the underworld allowed people to kill animals, provided people responded in certain ritual ways, such as taking fragments of animals into the caves and inserting them into the “membrane”.’ This is borne out in the San. Like other shamanistic societies, they have admiring practices between human hunters and their prey, suffused with taboos derived from extensive natural knowledge. These practices suggest that honouring may be one method of softening the disquiet of killing. It should be said that this disquiet needn’t arise because there is something fundamentally wrong with a human killing another animal, but simply because we are aware of doing the killing. And perhaps, too, because in some sense we ‘know’ what we are killing. We make sound guesses that the pain and desire for life we feel — our worlds of experience — have a counterpart in the animal we kill. As predators, this can create problems for us. One way to smooth those edges, then, is to . * membrane: 지하 세계로 통하는 바위 표면 ** suffused with: ～로 가득 찬 ① view that prey with respect ② domesticate those animals ③ develop tools for hunting ④ avoid supernatural beliefs ⑤ worship our ancestors’ spirits 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. The empiricist philosopher John Locke argued that when the human being was first born, the mind was simply a blank slate — a tabula rasa — waiting to be written on by experience. Locke believed that our experience shapes who we are and who we become — and therefore he also believed that, given different experiences, human beings would have different characters. The influence of these ideas was profound, particularly for the new colonies in America, for example, because these were conscious attempts to make a new start and to form a new society. The new society was to operate on a different basis from that of European culture, which was based on the feudal system in which people’s place in society was almost entirely determined by birth, and which therefore tended to emphasize innate characteristics. Locke’s emphasis on the importance of experience in forming the human being provided . * empiricist: 경험주의자 ** slate: 석판 *** feudal: 봉건 제도의 ①foundations for reinforcing ties between European and colonial societies ②new opportunities for European societies to value their tradition ③an optimistic framework for those trying to form a different society ④an example of the role that nature plays in building character ⑤an access to expertise in the areas of philosophy and science 34. In A Theory of Adaptation, Linda Hutcheon argues that “An adaptation is not vampiric: it does not draw the life­blood from its source and leave it dying or dead, nor is it paler than the adapted work. It may, on the contrary, keep that prior work alive, giving it an afterlife it would never have had otherwise.” Hutcheon’s refusal to see adaptation as “vampiric” is particularly inspiring for those of us who do work on adaptations. The idea of an “afterlife” of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works “alive.” Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present — functioning as both “monuments” to history and the “flesh” of the reader’s lived experience. While this is true for adaptations in general, it is especially important for those written with young adults in mind. Such adaptations that might otherwise come across as old­fashioned or irrelevant. ①allow young readers to make personal connections with texts ②are nothing more than the combination of different styles ③break familiar patterns of the ancient heroic stories ④give a new spotlight to various literary theories ⑤encourage young writers to make plots original 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? According to the principle of social proof, one way individuals determine appropriate behavior for themselves in a situation is to examine the behavior of others there — especially similar others. ①It is through social comparison with these referent others that people validate the correctness of their opinions and decisions. ②Consequently, people tend to behave as their friends and peers have behaved. ③Because the critical source of information within the principle of social proof is the responses of referent others, compliance tactics that employ this information should be especially effective in collectivistically oriented nations and persons. ④That is, where the individualized self is both the focus and the standard, one’s own behavioral history should be heavily weighted in subsequent behavior. ⑤Some evidence in this regard comes from a study showing that advertisements that promoted group benefits were more persuasive in Korea (a collectivistic society) than in the United States (an individualistic society). * tactic: 전술",

In A Theory of Adaptation, Linda Hutcheon argues that “An adaptation is not vampiric: it does not draw the life­blood from its source and leave it dying or dead, nor is it paler than the adapted work.

The idea of an “afterlife” of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works “alive.” Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present — functioning as both “monuments” to history and the “flesh” of the reader’s lived experience.

Aristotle explains that the Good for human beings consists in eudaimoniā (a Greek word combining eu meaning “good” with daimon meaning “spirit,” and most often translated as “happiness”). (A) It depends only on knowledge of human nature and other worldly and social realities. For him it is the study of human nature and worldly existence that will disclose the relevant meaning of the notion of eudaimoniā. (B) Some people say it is worldly enjoyment while others say it is eternal salvation. Aristotle’s theory will turn out to be “naturalistic” in that it does not depend on any theological or metaphysical knowledge. It does not depend on knowledge of God or of metaphysical and universal moral norms. (C) Whereas he had argued in a purely formal way that the Good was that to which we all aim, he now gives a more substantive answer: that this universal human goal is happiness.

Clearly the affective reaction to the thought of receiving a shock was overwhelming the subjects’ ability to evaluate the probabilities associated. (B) This is often a very rational attribute to substitute — affect does convey useful signals as to the costs and benefits of outcomes. A problem sometimes arises, however, when affective valuation is not supplemented by any analytic processing and adjustment at all. (C) For example, sole reliance on affective valuation can make people insensitive to probabilities and to quantitative features of the outcome that should effect decisions. One study demonstrated that people’s evaluation of a situation where they might receive a shock is insensitive to the probability of receiving the shock because their thinking is swamped by affective evaluation of the situation. * swamp: 압도하다 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",

        "text": "37.A large body of research in decision science has indicated that one attribute that is regularly substituted for an explicit assessment of decision costs and benefits is an affective valuation of the prospect at hand. (A) People were willing to pay almost as much to avoid a 1 percent probability of receiving a shock as they were to pay to avoid a 99 percent probability of receiving a shock. Clearly the affective reaction to the thought of receiving a shock was overwhelming the subjects’ ability to evaluate the probabilities associated. (B) This is often a very rational attribute to substitute —affect does convey useful signals as to the costs and benefits of outcomes.

(C) He then put him into a large bag, and carried (c) him away. Poor Nick, who was in great fear, did all he could do to escape from his cruel captor. He tried to tear the bag, but the giant only laughed at (d) him. At last, the giant came to his own house with a high wall all around it, and no trees, nor flowers. He put Nick into a prison. It was quite a dark room, with iron bars all around it. (D) He told Nick to sing, the same as he did when he was in his own home. “Sing! sing! sing!” said he, “Why don’t you sing?” But Nick was too sad to sing. Who could sing in a prison! At length the giant grew very angry, and took Nick out of the prison to make him sing. (e) He shook him, and then ordered him to sing. Nick felt terrified while missing whatever he enjoyed with freedom at his home. Now I will tell you who they were. Nick was a little bird and that giant was a cruel boy. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① Nick은 개울에서 물을 마시려고 몸을 숙였다. ② Nick은 감옥에서 도망치려 했으나 성공하지 못했다. ③ 거인의 집에는 나무와 꽃이 없었다. ④ Nick은 감옥에서 자신의 집에서처럼 노래를 불렀다. ⑤ 화가 난 거인은 Nick을 감옥에서 꺼냈다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오.",

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) Now I will tell you a story. There lived a young boy named Nick. He would sing and whistle nearly all day. He was as merry as a lark. One day Nick went out taking a walk in the forest, at some distance from his home. When he reached a clear stream he felt very thirsty and bent down to drink water. But, just at that moment, he was suddenly seized and found himself in the hands of a fierce giant, a hundred times bigger than himself. For some time the giant held Nick in his big hands, and looked at (a) him with great delight. (B) Nick was very miserable, for he had never before been deprived of his liberty. He dashed backward and forward in his prison­house, but he could not escape. (b) He thought of his own pleasant home, his companions, the sunlight, the trees, and the flowers. He screamed and tried to get out between the iron bars, but he only tore himself, and all in vain. In a moment, the giant came again to the prison. (C) He then put him into a large bag, and carried (c) him away. Poor Nick, who was in great fear, did all he could do to escape from his cruel captor. He tried to tear the bag, but the giant only laughed at (d) him. At last, the giant came to his own house with a high wall all around it, and no trees, nor flowers. He put Nick into a prison. It was quite a dark room, with iron bars all around it.
