It would also help if you could provide me with some samples of the gloves you produce. I hope to hear from you soon.

Finally, it came to my turn. I was supposed to walk backward off the cliff. Just looking down the cliff made my legs begin to shake. I knew there was a safety rope around me in case I should black out. I had an intellectual understanding of the whole situation and an intellectual sense of security. Nevertheless, my hair stood on end and I shivered all over. That first step off the cliff was the most difficult moment, but I made it ⸻as did others. I arrived safely at the bottom, overjoyed by the success of meeting the challenge. I felt as though I was walking on air. ① relaxed → nervous ② angry → ashamed ③ terrified → delighted ④ envious → sympathetic ⑤ disappointed → hopeful 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Conflicts between the goals of science and the need to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants result in the central ethical tension of clinical research. The statement “Bad science is bad ethics” is true. Putting humans at risk if the study design does not permit a reasonable expectation of valid findings is never ethical. Even a study that presents no risk presents at least an inconvenience to participants and is in that sense disrespectful. The statement “Good science is good ethics,” however, is false. Study design may be scientifically valid, yet the risk of harming human participants is too great to accept. Although achieving the appropriate scientific ends is always the necessary goal of a study, protection of the rights and welfare of human participants must override scientific efficiency. ① 참가자에게 임상 연구 결과를 투명하게 공개해야 한다. ② 임상 연구 과정에서 진행자의 편견이 배제되어야 한다. ③ 인간을 대상으로 하는 다양한 임상 연구를 시도해야 한다. ④ 임상 연구 설계 시 연구 목적을 구체적으로 설정해야 한다. ⑤ 임상 연구에서 참가자의 권리와 복지 보호가 우선되어야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 carries the stamp of this age가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Thomas Edison’s name is synonymous with invention, and his most famous invention, the electric light bulb, is a familiar symbol for that flash of inspired genius traditionally associated with the inventive act. Besides being the exemplar of the “bright idea,” however, Edison’s electric light is worthy of study for other reasons. The technical and economic importance of the light and of the electrical system that surrounded it matches that of any other invention we could name, at least from the last two hundred years. The introduction and spread of electric light and power was one of the key steps in the transformation of the world from an industrial age, characterized by iron and coal and steam, to a post‑industrial one, in which electricity was joined by petroleum, light metals and alloys, and internal combustion engines to give the twentieth century its distinctive form and character. Our own time still largely carries the stamp of this age, however dazzled we may be by the electronic, computerized, and media wonders of the twenty‑first century. * alloy: 합금 ① combines creative ideas from various disciplines ② strives to overcome limitations of the industrial age ③ is a theoretical background for academic exploration ④ is under the influence of earlier electrical innovations ⑤ is dependent on resources reserved for future generations 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Just imagine that we have invented special glasses that give us the power to see the odorous world the way that other organisms perceive it. Put your pair on and walk outside for just a moment. As the bright sunlight hits our eyes, we would encounter a world far different from what we would normally expect. The air is full of molecules carried by breezes. Chemical signals would flood our eyes just as surely as sounds overwhelm our ears at a cocktail party. Stare at any plant and you would see compounds being released into the air from leaves, bark, and roots. A squirrel in a tree exudes carbon dioxide and other compounds with each breath. Glance along its brown body and notice that specific points (scent glands) appear to be slowly releasing chemical signals. If we could translate these signals into language, we would see phrases, sentences, statements, songs, and other messages waiting to be intercepted and interpreted. * exude: 발산하다 ** gland: (분비)샘 ① 인간이 보지 못하는 것을 볼 수 있는 유기체가 매우 많다. ② 세상은 인간이 지각하지 못하는 화학 신호로 가득 차 있다. ③ 동물과 식물의 감각 기관은 외부 자극에 일정하게 반응한다. ④ 동물과 식물은 화학 물질의 발산을 통해 스스로를 보호한다. ⑤ 시각적 인식이 다른 모든 감각에 의한 인식보다 더 우선한다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Skills‑based approaches to teaching critical thinking now have a long history and literature, but what has become clear through more than 25 years of work on critical thinking theory and pedagogy is that teaching students a set of thinking skills does not seem to be enough. Students may learn to write an adequate article critique in one class, but fail to use those skills in another. They may learn how to evaluate research methodology in other students’ research designs, but completely miss the flaws in their own. They may learn to recognize thinking biases in the classroom, but still use badly flawed reasoning in their own decision making. Too often students think our courses are either about memorizing a great deal of material, or about learning the rules for and playing one more idiosyncratic academic game. Students regularly fail to understand what we are trying to teach them or they fail to transfer and generalize thinking skills across contexts and classes. * pedagogy: 교수법 ** idiosyncratic: 특유한 ① importance of critical thinking in school learning ② limitations of teaching thinking skills to students ③ impacts of thinking biases on academic performance ④ application of various teaching methods in classrooms ⑤ necessity of evaluating students’ critical thinking skills 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? As much as we like to think of ourselves as being different and special, humans are a part of Earth’s biosphere, created within and by it. Ultimately, it is the living, breathing elements of this world that we need more than inanimate supplies, such as coal, gas, or bauxite ore. We can live without cars or beer cans, but we cannot without food and oxygen. As nations around the globe try to band together to attack the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and the shrinking availability of fresh drinking water, in all corners of the world thousands of species quietly go extinct. E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard biologist, recently presented the problem our species faces in a succinct law: “If you save the living environment, the biodiversity that we have left, you will also automatically save the physical environment, too. But if you only save the physical environment, you will ultimately lose both.” * biosphere: 생물권 ** ore: 광석 *** succinct: 간결한 ① Save Biodiversity to Save the Earth ② Invasive Alien Species Threaten Biodiversity ③ Potentiality and Utilization of Renewable Energy ④ Tackling Climate Change Has a Long Way to Go ⑤ Worldwide Efforts to Protect Endangered Species 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the CO2 emissions from cars versus ships in Europe in 2019. ①Among the eight countries, the CO2 emissions from ships were larger than those from cars except for Belgium. ②The Netherlands had the largest CO2 emissions from both cars and ships, whereas Sweden had the smallest CO2 emissions from both. ③The CO2 emissions from ships were larger in Spain than in the United Kingdom, but the CO2 emissions from cars were larger in the United Kingdom than in Spain. ④Germany’s CO2 emissions from ships were more than twice those of Sweden. ⑤The gap between the CO2 emissions from cars and ships was the largest in the Netherlands and the smallest in Italy and France. 26. Josef Sudek에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Josef Sudek was born in the Czech Republic. Originally a bookbinder, Sudek was badly injured during World War I, resulting in the loss of his right arm. After the injury, he spent three years in various hospitals, and began to take photographs out of boredom. In 1922, he enrolled at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, where he studied photography for two years. His army disability pension allowed him to make art without worrying about an income. He photographed many night‑scapes of Prague and the wooded landscapes of Bohemia. Sudek didn’t let his disability get in the way and, despite having only one arm, he used very heavy and bulky equipment. Often known as the ‘Poet of Prague,’ Sudek never married, and was a shy and retiring person. He never appeared at his exhibition openings.

Just as there’s a tendency to glorify technological progress, there’s a countertendency to expect the worst of every new tool or machine.

Finally, it came to my turn. I was supposed to walk backward off the cliff. Just looking down the cliff made my legs begin to shake. I knew there was a safety rope around me in case I should black out. I had an intellectual understanding of the whole situation and an intellectual sense of security. Nevertheless, my hair stood on end and I shivered all over. That first step off the cliff was the most difficult moment, but I made it ⸻as did others. I arrived safely at the bottom, overjoyed by the success of meeting the challenge. I felt as though I was walking on air. ① relaxed → nervous ② angry → ashamed ③ terrified → delighted ④ envious → sympathetic ⑤ disappointed → hopeful 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Conflicts between the goals of science and the need to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants result in the central ethical tension of clinical research. The statement “Bad science is bad ethics” is true. Putting humans at risk if the study design does not permit a reasonable expectation of valid findings is never ethical. Even a study that presents no risk presents at least an inconvenience to participants and is in that sense disrespectful. The statement “Good science is good ethics,” however, is false. Study design may be scientifically valid, yet the risk of harming human participants is too great to accept. Although achieving the appropriate scientific ends is always the necessary goal of a study, protection of the rights and welfare of human participants must override scientific efficiency. ① 참가자에게 임상 연구 결과를 투명하게 공개해야 한다. ② 임상 연구 과정에서 진행자의 편견이 배제되어야 한다. ③ 인간을 대상으로 하는 다양한 임상 연구를 시도해야 한다. ④ 임상 연구 설계 시 연구 목적을 구체적으로 설정해야 한다. ⑤ 임상 연구에서 참가자의 권리와 복지 보호가 우선되어야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 carries the stamp of this age가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Thomas Edison’s name is synonymous with invention, and his most famous invention, the electric light bulb, is a familiar symbol for that flash of inspired genius traditionally associated with the inventive act. Besides being the exemplar of the “bright idea,” however, Edison’s electric light is worthy of study for other reasons. The technical and economic importance of the light and of the electrical system that surrounded it matches that of any other invention we could name, at least from the last two hundred years. The introduction and spread of electric light and power was one of the key steps in the transformation of the world from an industrial age, characterized by iron and coal and steam, to a post‑industrial one, in which electricity was joined by petroleum, light metals and alloys, and internal combustion engines to give the twentieth century its distinctive form and character. Our own time still largely carries the stamp of this age, however dazzled we may be by the electronic, computerized, and media wonders of the twenty‑first century. * alloy: 합금 ① combines creative ideas from various disciplines ② strives to overcome limitations of the industrial age ③ is a theoretical background for academic exploration ④ is under the influence of earlier electrical innovations ⑤ is dependent on resources reserved for future generations 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Just imagine that we have invented special glasses that give us the power to see the odorous world the way that other organisms perceive it. Put your pair on and walk outside for just a moment. As the bright sunlight hits our eyes, we would encounter a world far different from what we would normally expect. The air is full of molecules carried by breezes. Chemical signals would flood our eyes just as surely as sounds overwhelm our ears at a cocktail party. Stare at any plant and you would see compounds being released into the air from leaves, bark, and roots. A squirrel in a tree exudes carbon dioxide and other compounds with each breath. Glance along its brown body and notice that specific points (scent glands) appear to be slowly releasing chemical signals. If we could translate these signals into language, we would see phrases, sentences, statements, songs, and other messages waiting to be intercepted and interpreted. * exude: 발산하다 ** gland: (분비)샘 ① 인간이 보지 못하는 것을 볼 수 있는 유기체가 매우 많다. ② 세상은 인간이 지각하지 못하는 화학 신호로 가득 차 있다. ③ 동물과 식물의 감각 기관은 외부 자극에 일정하게 반응한다. ④ 동물과 식물은 화학 물질의 발산을 통해 스스로를 보호한다. ⑤ 시각적 인식이 다른 모든 감각에 의한 인식보다 더 우선한다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Skills‑based approaches to teaching critical thinking now have a long history and literature, but what has become clear through more than 25 years of work on critical thinking theory and pedagogy is that teaching students a set of thinking skills does not seem to be enough. Students may learn to write an adequate article critique in one class, but fail to use those skills in another. They may learn how to evaluate research methodology in other students’ research designs, but completely miss the flaws in their own. They may learn to recognize thinking biases in the classroom, but still use badly flawed reasoning in their own decision making. Too often students think our courses are either about memorizing a great deal of material, or about learning the rules for and playing one more idiosyncratic academic game. Students regularly fail to understand what we are trying to teach them or they fail to transfer and generalize thinking skills across contexts and classes. * pedagogy: 교수법 ** idiosyncratic: 특유한 ① importance of critical thinking in school learning ② limitations of teaching thinking skills to students ③ impacts of thinking biases on academic performance ④ application of various teaching methods in classrooms ⑤ necessity of evaluating students’ critical thinking skills 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? As much as we like to think of ourselves as being different and special, humans are a part of Earth’s biosphere, created within and by it. Ultimately, it is the living, breathing elements of this world that we need more than inanimate supplies, such as coal, gas, or bauxite ore. We can live without cars or beer cans, but we cannot without food and oxygen. As nations around the globe try to band together to attack the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and the shrinking availability of fresh drinking water, in all corners of the world thousands of species quietly go extinct. E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard biologist, recently presented the problem our species faces in a succinct law: “If you save the living environment, the biodiversity that we have left, you will also automatically save the physical environment, too. But if you only save the physical environment, you will ultimately lose both.” * biosphere: 생물권 ** ore: 광석 *** succinct: 간결한 ① Save Biodiversity to Save the Earth ② Invasive Alien Species Threaten Biodiversity ③ Potentiality and Utilization of Renewable Energy ④ Tackling Climate Change Has a Long Way to Go ⑤ Worldwide Efforts to Protect Endangered Species 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the CO2 emissions from cars versus ships in Europe in 2019. ①Among the eight countries, the CO2 emissions from ships were larger than those from cars except for Belgium. ②The Netherlands had the largest CO2 emissions from both cars and ships, whereas Sweden had the smallest CO2 emissions from both. ③The CO2 emissions from ships were larger in Spain than in the United Kingdom, but the CO2 emissions from cars were larger in the United Kingdom than in Spain. ④Germany’s CO2 emissions from ships were more than twice those of Sweden. ⑤The gap between the CO2 emissions from cars and ships was the largest in the Netherlands and the smallest in Italy and France. 26. Josef Sudek에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Josef Sudek was born in the Czech Republic. Originally a bookbinder, Sudek was badly injured during World War I, resulting in the loss of his right arm. After the injury, he spent three years in various hospitals, and began to take photographs out of boredom. In 1922, he enrolled at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, where he studied photography for two years. His army disability pension allowed him to make art without worrying about an income. He photographed many night‑scapes of Prague and the wooded landscapes of Bohemia. Sudek didn’t let his disability get in the way and, despite having only one arm, he used very heavy and bulky equipment. Often known as the ‘Poet of Prague,’ Sudek never married, and was a shy and retiring person. He never appeared at his exhibition openings.

If we could translate these signals into language, we would see phrases, sentences, statements, songs, and other messages waiting to be intercepted and interpreted.* exude: 발산하다  ** gland: (분비)샘① 인간이 보지 못하는 것을 볼 수 있는 유기체가 매우 많다.② 세상은 인간이 지각하지 못하는 화학 신호로 가득 차 있다.③ 동물과 식물의 감각 기관은 외부 자극에 일정하게 반응한다.④ 동물과 식물은 화학 물질의 발산을 통해 스스로를 보호한다.⑤ 시각적 인식이 다른 모든 감각에 의한 인식보다 더 우선한다."

Students may learn to write an adequate article critique in one class, but fail to use those skills in another. They may learn how to evaluate research methodology in other students’ research designs, but completely miss the flaws in their own. They may learn to recognize thinking biases in the classroom, but still use badly flawed reasoning in their own decision making. Too often students think our courses are either about memorizing a great deal of material, or about learning the rules for and playing one more idiosyncratic academic game. Students regularly fail to understand what we are trying to teach them or they fail to transfer and generalize thinking skills across contexts and classes.* pedagogy: 교수법  ** idiosyncratic: 특유한① importance of critical thinking in school learning② limitations of teaching thinking skills to students③ impacts of thinking biases on academic performance④ application of various teaching methods in classrooms⑤ necessity of evaluating students’ critical thinking skills"

Ultimately, it is the living, breathing elements of this world that we need more than inanimate supplies, such as coal, gas, or bauxite ore. We can live without cars or beer cans, but we cannot without food and oxygen. As nations around the globe try to band together to attack the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and the shrinking availability of fresh drinking water, in all corners of the world thousands of species quietly go extinct. E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard biologist, recently presented the problem our species faces in a succinct law: “If you save the living environment, the biodiversity that we have left, you will also automatically save the physical environment, too. But if you only save the physical environment, you will ultimately lose both.”* biosphere: 생물권  ** ore: 광석  *** succinct: 간결한① Save Biodiversity to Save the Earth② Invasive Alien Species Threaten Biodiversity③ Potentiality and Utilization of Renewable Energy④ Tackling Climate Change Has a Long Way to Go⑤ Worldwide Efforts to Protect Endangered Species4영어영역고348"

After the injury, he spent three years in various hospitals, and began to take photographs out of boredom. In 1922, he enrolled at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, where he studied photography for two years. His army disability pension allowed him to make art without worrying about an income. He photographed many night‑scapes of Prague and the wooded landscapes of Bohemia. Sudek didn’t let his disability get in the way and, despite having only one arm, he used very heavy and bulky equipment. Often known as the ‘Poet of Prague,’ Sudek never married, and was a shy and retiring person. He never appeared at his exhibition openings. He died on 15 September 1976, when he was 80 years old.① 제1차 세계 대전 중 심한 부상으로 오른팔을 잃었다.② Prague에 있는 학교에서 2년 동안 사진술을 공부했다.③ 연금을 받아서 수입 걱정 없이 예술 창작을 할 수 있었다.④ 매우 무겁고 부피가 큰 장비를 사용했다.⑤ 자신의 전시회 개막식에 항상 참석했다."

But many signals, as they are passed from generation to generation by whatever means, go through changes that make them either more elaborate or simply different. Many of the ritualized displays performed by animals look so bizarre to us that we wonder how they came about. ( ①) Most of the various forms of signaling that are used by different species of animals have not arisen afresh in each separate species. ( ②) As one species evolves into another, particular forms of signaling may be passed on, owing to the effects of both genes and learning or experience. ( ③) Some signals have significance across many species, and so remain much the same over generations and in a number of species. ( ④) If we examine closely related species, we can often see slight variations in a particular display and we can piece together an explanation for the spread of the display across species. ( ⑤) Some very elaborate displays may have begun as simpler versions of the same behavioral pattern that became more elaborate as they developed and were passed on from generation to generation. * bizarre: 기이한 39. If the goal is to figure out how best to cover a set curriculum — to fill students with facts — then it might seem appropriate to try to maximize time on task, such as by assigning homework. Carole Ames, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, points out that it isn’t “quantitative changes in behavior” (such as requiring students to spend more hours in front of books or worksheets) that help children to learn better. ( ①) Rather, it’s “qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.” ( ②) In turn, these attitudes and responses on the part of students emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, the ways they’ve organized their classrooms. ( ③) But that’s unlikely to have a positive effect on the critical variables that Ames identifies. ( ④) Perhaps it makes sense to see education as being less about how much the teacher covers and more about what the students can be helped to discover. ( ⑤) More time won’t do a thing to bring about that shift. 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? Why would languages and religions increase rapidly around the equator, and why is their frequency also related to ethnocentrism? The answer to these questions lies in the fact that pathogen density is much higher in the tropics than it is in temperate and cold climates. When you live in Sweden, chances are good that any group within five hundred miles has been exposed to the same few pathogens. In contrast, when you live in the Congo, the group on the other side of the valley may well have been exposed to a pathogen with which you’ve had no prior contact. For this reason, humans in the tropics learned that when they interacted with other groups they tended to get sick, so they would have stopped doing it.

If the goal is to figure out how best to cover a set curriculum — to fill students with facts — then it might seem appropriate to try to maximize time on task, such as by assigning homework. Carole Ames, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, points out that it isn’t “quantitative changes in behavior” (such as requiring students to spend more hours in front of books or worksheets) that help children to learn better. ( ①) Rather, it’s “qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.” ( ②) In turn, these attitudes and responses on the part of students emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, the ways they’ve organized their classrooms.

Why would languages and religions increase rapidly around the equator, and why is their frequency also related to ethnocentrism? The answer to these questions lies in the fact that pathogen density is much higher in the tropics than it is in temperate and cold climates. When you live in Sweden, chances are good that any group within five hundred miles has been exposed to the same few pathogens. In contrast, when you live in the Congo, the group on the other side of the valley may well have been exposed to a pathogen with which you’ve had no prior contact. For this reason, humans in the tropics learned that when they interacted with other groups they tended to get sick, so they would have stopped doing it.
