        "text": "20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?As the world seems to be increasingly affected by the ever-expanding influence of machines in general and artificial intelligence (AI) specifically, many begin to imagine, with either fear or anticipation, a future with a diminished role for human decision making. Whether it be due to the growing presence of AI assistants or the emergence of self-driving cars, the necessity of the role of humans as the decision makers would appear to be in decline. After all, our capacity for making mistakes is well documented. However, perhaps the saving grace of human determination is to be found here as well. Little evidence exists that suggests modern AI’s infallibility or predicts it in the future. It is crucial that, in light of humanity’s acceptance of our own fallibility, we utilize our capacity to overcome such failures to position ourselves as the overseers of AI’s own growth and applications for the foreseeable future.①인간은 AI의 발전 가능성과 불안정성을 동시에 고려해야 한다.②인간은 창의력을 향상시키기 위해 AI에 의존하지 말아야 한다.③실수를 보완하기 위해 인간은 AI의 활용 방안을 모색해야 한다.④AI에 대한 학습을 통해 인간은 미래 사회 변화에 대비해야 한다.⑤AI의 영향력 확산에 대비하여 인간은 오류 극복 능력을 활용해야 한다.Hello, everyone!

In most public discussion of burnout, we talk about workers who “are burned out,” as if that status were black and white. A black-and-white view cannot account for the variety of burnout experience, though. If there is a clear line between burned out and not, as there is with a lightbulb, then we have no good way to categorize people who say they are burned out but still manage to do their work competently. Thinking about burnout as a spectrum solves this problem; those who claim burnout but are not debilitated by it are simply dealing with a partial or less-severe form of it. They are experiencing burnout without being burned out. Burnout hasn’t had the last word.* debilitate: 쇠약하게 하다①Public discussion of burnout has not reached an end.②There still exists room for a greater degree of exhaustion.③All-or-nothing criteria are applicable to burnout symptoms.④Exhaustion is overcome in different ways based on its severity.⑤Degrees of exhaustion are shaped by individuals’ perceptions."

The fact that everyone was going to be able to speak and listen had to be accommodated ethically, and it was via a rough egalitarianism. In terms of communications, people were equal and therefore it was believed they should be equal, or at least relatively so. By this code, ancient Big Men were not allowed to act controllingly and modern office managers are not allowed to silence anyone at will. Moreover, equal access to speech and hearing promoted the notion that property should be held in common, that goods and food in particular should be shared, and that everyone had a duty to take care of everyone else. This was probably more true among hunter-gatherers than it is in the modern family, circle of friends, or workplace. But even in these cases we believe that sharing and mutual aid are right and proper. Remember, if you bring something, you should bring enough for everyone.* diffusion: 확산** egalitarianism: 인류 평등주의①수렵인과 현대인은 언어에 대한 유사한 가치를 가지고 있다.②인간은 언어를 사용하여 자원을 보다 효율적으로 배분해 왔다.③현대 사회는 고대 수렵 사회보다 평등한 체계에 의해 운영된다.④인간 의사소통의 평등성은 공유와 공조 가치 기반을 형성했다.⑤인간은 의사소통을 통해 자원을 공유하는 평등한 사회를 건설했다."

Indeed, the nature claimed by many ads was associated with food products only by the ads’ attachment. This is clearly a case of what French sociologist Henri Lefebvre has called “the decline of the referentials,” or the tendency of words under the influence of capitalism to become separated from meaningful associations. Increasingly, food ads helped shoppers become accustomed to new definitions of words such as “fresh” and “natural,” definitions that could well be considered opposite of their traditional meanings. The new definitions better served the needs of the emerging industrial food system, which could not supply foods that matched customary meanings and expectations. And they better met shoppers’ desires, although with pretense.①decline of reliability in the ads of natural foods②changes in the senses of words linked to food ads③influence of capitalism on the industrial food system④various ways to attract customers in the food industry ⑤necessity of meaningful word associations in commercials"

A few thousand years ago ancient Egyptian and then ancient Greek art presented human forms in shadow-style silhouette. But cast shadows do not appear in Western art until about 400 BCE in Athens. It was only after shadows had become an established, if controversial, part of representation that classical writers claimed that art itself had begun with the tracing of a human shadow. Greeks and Romans were the first to make the transition from modeling shadows to cast shadows, a practice that implied a consistent light source, a fixed point of view, and an understanding of geometric projection. In fact, what we might now call “shadow studies”― the exploration of shadows in their various artistic representations ― has its roots in ancient Athens. Ever since, the practice of portraying shadows has evolved along with critical analysis of them, as artists and theoreticians have engaged in an ongoing debate about the significance of shadow representation. * geometric: 기하학의①The Journey of Shadows in Art from Prehistoric Caves Onward②Portrayals of Human Shadows from the Artistic Perspective③Representing Shadows as a Key Part of Contemporary Art④What Are the Primary Challenges for Shadow Painters?⑤Unique Views on Shadows: From Cave Artists to Romans이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.448"

He left the U.S. in 1902 and worked as a cowboy and roping artist in South Africa and Australia. After returning to the U.S., he appeared in more than 50 movies and was often heard on the radio as an entertainer. He was also an outstanding newspaper columnist with his wit and humor, writing more than 4,000 columns. He unfortunately died at the height of his career in 1935. Rogers was so popular that after his death his statue was installed in the U.S. Capitol.

A bit stream looks the same to a computer regardless of the media it is read from.

Ideas that are original but not useful are irrelevant, and ideas that are useful but not original are unremarkable. While this definition is widely used in research, an important aspect of creativity is often ignored: Generating creative ideas rarely is the final goal. Rather, to successfully solve problems or innovate requires one or a few good ideas that really work, and work better than previous approaches. This requires that people evaluate the products of their own or each other’s imagination, and choose those ideas that seem promising enough to develop further, and abandon those that are unlikely to be successful.

        "text": "34. Any attempt to model musical behavior or perception in a general way is filled with difficulties. With regard to models of perception, the question arises of whose perception we are trying to model ― even if we confine ourselves to a particular culture and historical environment. Surely the perception of music varies greatly between listeners of different levels of training; indeed, a large part of music education is devoted to developing and enriching (and therefore likely changing) these listening processes. While this may be true, I am concerned here with fairly basic aspects of perception ― particularly meter and key ― which I believe are relatively consistent across listeners. Anecdotal evidence suggests, for example, that most people are able to ‘‘find the beat’’ in a typical folk song or classical piece. This is not to say that there is complete uniformity in this regard ―there may be occasional disagreements, even among experts, as to how we hear the tonality or meter of a piece. But I believe .

The intentional setting of fire to manage the landscape was practised by Aboriginal people for millennia.(A) However, the pattern of burning that stockmen introduced was unlike previous regimes. When conditions allowed, they would set fire to the landscape as they moved their animals out for the winter. This functioned to clear woody vegetation and also stimulated new plant growth in the following spring.(B) Although grasses were the first kinds of plants to recolonize the burnt areas they were soon succeeded by further woody plants and shrubs. About the only strategy to prevent such regrowth was further burning ― essentially using fire to control the consequences of using fire.(C) The young shoots were a ready food source for their animals when they returned. However, the practice also tended to reinforce the scrubby growth it was intended to control. * regime: 양식** scrubby: 관목이 우거진①③⑤(A)(B)(C)－－－(C)(C)(B)－－－(B)(A)(A)②④(B)(C)－－(A)(A)－－(C)(B)이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.778"

To do this, human resource development professionals must be able to think systematically and understand how to promote learning within groups and across the organization.(B) For example, performance evaluation and reward systems that reinforce long-term performance and the development and sharing of new skills and knowledge are particularly important. In addition, the human resource development function may be dramatically changed to keep the emphasis on continuous learning.(C) In a learning organization, every employee must take the responsibility for acquiring and transferring knowledge.

The potential contribution of greater economic success, if it involves vulnerable groups, cannot be denied. At the same time, it is important to recognize that, no matter how fast they grow, countries where a large part of the population derive their livelihood from uncertain sources cannot hope to prevent famines without specialized entitlement protection mechanisms involving direct public intervention. Rapid growth of the economy in Botswana, or of the agricultural sector in Kenya, or of food production in Zimbabwe, explains at best only a small part of their success in preventing recurrent threats of famine.
