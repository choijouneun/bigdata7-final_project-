For the theme, we wanted artists to explore the natural world of Caroline County. I believe the Garden Café Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event, as your gallery is well-known for its beautiful garden. The exhibition is usually held throughout October, and we very much hope that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Café Gallery during this time. I look forward to your response.

One study showed that, within the workplace, peers influence each other to spot opportunities and act on them: the more entrepreneurs you have working together in an office, the more likely their colleagues will catch the bug. A study of Stanford University alumni found that those “who have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more likely to start their own businesses than those who have focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at school.” To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture, colleges and universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences and wide exposure to different ideas. They are uniquely positioned to do this by combining the resources of academic programming, residential life, student groups, and alumni networks. * entrepreneur: 기업가  ** alumni: 졸업생①훌륭한 기업가가 되기 위해서 관심 있는 한 분야에 집중해야 한다.②대학은 학생들이 기업가 정신을 함양하도록 환경을 조성해야 한다.③좋은 직장을 얻기 위해서 학업과 대외 활동에 충실해야 한다. ④기업은 대학생들의 다양한 소모임 활동을 적극 지원해야 한다. ⑤대학생은 학업 성취를 위하여 경험과 생각의 폭을 넓혀야 한다.  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.338"

After you eat, you don’t have to figure out why you aren’t hungry anymore. All these things are expected and are therefore not problems to solve. Furthermore, imagine how demanding it would be to always consider all the possible uses for all the familiar objects with which you interact. Should I use my hammer or my telephone to pound in that nail? On a daily basis, functional fixedness is a relief, not a curse. That’s why you shouldn’t even attempt to consider all your options and possibilities. You can’t. If you tried to, then you’d never get anything done. So don’t knock the box. Ironically, although it limits your thinking, it also makes you smart. It helps you to stay one step ahead of reality.①Deal with a matter based on your habitual expectations.②Question what you expect from a familiar object.③Replace predetermined routines with fresh ones.④Think over all possible outcomes of a given situation.⑤Extend all the boundaries that guide your thinking to insight."

Music is social, and tightly woven into the tapestry of life, and young children are very much a part of this multifaceted fabric. The musical experiences they have provide opportunities for them to know language, behaviors, customs, traditions, beliefs, values, stories, and other cultural nuances. As they become musically skilled through experiences in song and instrumental music, young children can also grow cultural knowledge and sensitivity. Music is an extremely important aspect of culture, shaping and transmitting the above-mentioned aspects that characterize groups of people. Exposing young children to the world’s musical cultures brings them into the cultural conversation, allowing them to learn about self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way. Prior to the development of social biases and cultural preferences that all too easily turn into prejudices, the opportunity to know people through song, dance, and instrument play is a gift to all who work for the well-balanced development of young children into the responsible citizens they will one day become.* tapestry: 색색의 실로 수놓은 장식 걸개  ** multifaceted: 다면의①아이들의 균형 잡힌 성장을 위해서는 다양한 경험이 중요하다.②사회적 편견과 문화적 선호도는 서로 밀접하게 관련되어 있다.③어린 나이에 다양한 음악에 노출되면 예술적 감각이 향상된다.④음악을 포함한 예술은 특정 문화에 대한 당대의 사회적 시각을 반영한다. ⑤음악은 아이들을 사회･문화적으로 균형 잡힌 시민으로 성장하게 해 준다."

[3점]Conventional wisdom in the West, influenced by philosophers from Plato to Descartes, credits individuals and especially geniuses with creativity and originality. Social and cultural influences and causes are minimized, ignored, or eliminated from consideration at all. Thoughts, original and conventional, are identified with individuals, and the special things that individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains. The “trick” here is to recognize that individual humans are social constructions themselves, embodying and reflecting the variety of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to during their lives. Our individuality is not denied, but it is viewed as a product of specific social and cultural experiences. The brain itself is a social thing, influenced structurally and at the level of its connectivities by social environments. The “individual” is a legal, religious, and political fiction just as the “I” is a grammatical illusion. ①recognition of the social nature inherent in individuality②ways of filling the gap between individuality and collectivity③issues with separating original thoughts from conventional ones④acknowledgment of the true individuality embodied in human genes⑤necessity of shifting from individualism to interdependence"

The nineteenth century, as we have observed, was the last to believe that the world, as a whole as well as in its parts, could ever be perfectly known. We realize now that this is, and always was, impossible. We know within limits, not absolutely, even if the limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs. Curiously, from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge and appear to be attainable. Even if we cannot know the world with absolute precision, we can still control it. Even our inherently incomplete knowledge seems to work as powerfully as ever.

Originally born in France, Brunel escaped to the United States during the French Revolution. He later moved to London. When the Napoleonic Wars were at their height, he invented machines for making boots. During the Napoleonic Wars, Brunel’s factory supplied British troops with boots. After the Wars ended, however, the government stopped buying his boots and he went out of business. A few years later, Brunel was imprisoned for several months because of his debt. At that time, London was very much divided by the River Thames and needed more ways for people and goods to move across it. In 1825, Brunel designed a tunnel under the river. The Thames Tunnel officially opened on 25 March 1843, and Brunel, despite being in ill health, attended the opening ceremony.①프랑스 혁명 중에 미국으로 달아났다.②부츠를 만드는 기계를 발명하였다.③그의 공장은 영국 군대에 부츠를 공급한 적이 있다.④빚 때문에 감옥에 수감되었다.⑤Thames Tunnel 개통식에 아파서 참석하지 못했다."

Natural objects, such as roses, are not. They are not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages. They belong to no tradition, strictly speaking have no style, and are not understood within a framework of culture and convention. Rather, they are sensed and savored relatively directly, without intellectual mediation, and so what they are called, either individually or collectively, has little bearing on our experience of them. What a work of art is titled, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the qualities we correctly perceive in it. A painting of a rose, by a name other than the one it has, might very well smell different, aesthetically speaking.

The real threat to biodiversity is surely the need to convert ever more of our planet into production zones to feed the ever-increasing human population. The cloning and transgenic alteration of domestic animals makes little difference to the overall situation. Conversely, the renewed interest in genetics has led to a growing awareness that there are many wild plants and animals with interesting or useful genetic properties that could be used for a variety of as-yet-unknown purposes.

Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs mightin respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights.

But that few percent positive difference is compounded over decades into what we might call civilization. Its benefits never star in movies.

A report entitled Yearning for Balance, based on a nationwide survey of Americans, concluded that they were ‘deeply ambivalent about wealth and material gain’. A large majority of people wanted society to ‘move away from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on values, community, and family’. But they also felt that these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow Americans, who, they believed, had become ‘increasingly atomized, selfish, and irresponsible’. As a result they often felt isolated. However, the report says, that when brought together in focus groups to discuss these issues, people were ‘surprised and excited to find that others share[d] their views’. Rather than uniting us with others in a common cause, the unease we feel about the loss of social values and the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence which cuts us off from others.* ambivalent: 양면 가치의󰀻Many Americans, believing that materialism keeps them from(A)social values, feel detached from most others, but this is actually a fairly(B)concern.(A)(B)(A)(B)①pursuing …… unnecessary②pursuing …… common③holding …… personal④denying …… ethical⑤denying …… primary이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.888[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.To the extent that sufficient context has been provided, the reader can come to a well-crafted text with no expert knowledge and come away with a good approximation of what has been intended by the author.
