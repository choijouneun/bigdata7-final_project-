The piece of wreckage Anna held on to that served as a life preserver had a window. Now that there was light, she looked through it and down into the water. She wished she hadn’t. She spied dark shapes moving beneath her. What could they be? Fish? Sharks? Anna shook with fear, her blood running cold. The last bits of strength were draining away from her arms and upper body. She did not know how much longer she could hang on, but then Anna glanced up and couldn’t believe what she saw. A fishing boat was approaching over the big waves. After being in the water for 3 hours, she was finally rescued. When she got on the boat, she felt a sense of relief spread through her body. ① eager → sorrowful ② terrified → relieved ③ excited → confused ④ indifferent → irritated ⑤ confident → ashamed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? By definition, adult learners have a self­concept of being in charge of their own lives and have a need to be seen and treated as being capable of taking responsibility for their own learning. As such, learners need to be given the freedom and autonomy to assume responsibility for their own choices and to be proactive in making decisions that contribute to their educational experiences. Rather than perform the role of the “sage on the stage,” in working with adult learners, the instructor’s role should be the “guide on the side” — a facilitator of learning, and a coach or mentor who works alongside their learners to promote achievement and academic success. The facilitator role extends beyond course delivery, and includes the broader pedagogical tasks that will support learners on their growth such as helping them effectively manage their time; fostering engagement; assigning meaningful and relevant learning activities; and so on. * autonomy: 자율성, 자주성 ** sage: 현자 *** pedagogical: 교육적인 ①학 생 들 의 성 취 도 를 측 정 할 수 있 는 객 관 적 인 평 가 도 구 를 개 발 해 야 한 다 . ②성인 학습자를 가르치는 교사는 촉진자의 역할을 수행해야 한다. ③교사는 지식 전달을 최우선으로 하여 수업을 진행해야 한다. ④교사는 학생들의 연령에 상관없이 시각 자료를 활용해야 한다. ⑤성인 학습자는 새로운 것을 배울 때 더 많은 시간을 투자해야 한다. 고3 21. 다음 밑줄 친 you taste its price가 의미하는 바로 가장 적절 한 것은? That perception is a construction is not true just of one’s perception of sensory input, such as visual and auditory information. It is true of your social perceptions as well ― your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine’s taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn’t because the subjects consciously believed that the higher­priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn’t true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That’s related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don’t just taste the wine; you taste its price. ①Customer ratings determine the price of a product. ②We fool ourselves into thinking our unplanned buying was reasonable. ③We immediately dismiss opposing opinions without any consideration. ④The brain shows consistent response regardless of personal preference. ⑤The perceived value of a product influences one’s subjective experience of it. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Though it may seem extreme, a multilingual can quite literally feel differently about people, events or things when using one language versus another. The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well­being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true ― the second language is associated with post­immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language. * rattle: 당황하게하다 ** connotation: 함축(된 의미) *** persecution: 박해 ①다중 언어 환경은 모국어 학습 발달을 지연시킨다. ②모국어 실력이 뛰어날수록 외국어를 습득하는 속도가 빠르다. ③다중 언어 사용자는 사용하는 언어에 따라 다르게 느끼고 반응한다. ④부정적인 어휘가 긍정적인 어휘보다 감정에 미치는 영향이 크다. ⑤긍정적인 감정을 나타내는 어휘량이 문화권마다 다르다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Sociologist Brooke Harrington said if there was an  of social science, it would be SD > PD, “social death is more frightening than physical death.” This is why we feel deeply threatened when a new idea challenges the ones that have become part of our identity. For some ideas, the ones that identify us as members of a group, we don’t reason as individuals; we reason as a member of a tribe. We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that’s the one you will pick. * innate: 타고난 ① tendency to prefer the group that one identifies with ② necessity of social isolation to build a reputation ③ ways to ease one’s irrational fear of crowds ④ importance of forming groups with different interests ⑤ tips for staying objective during heated group discussions 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Distance in time is like distance in space. People matter even if they live thousands of miles away. Likewise, they matter even if they live thousands of years hence. In both cases, it’s easy to mistake distance for unreality, to treat the limits of what we can see as the limits of the world. But just as the world does not stop at our doorstep or our country’s borders, neither does it stop with our generation, or the next. These ideas are common sense. A popular proverb says, “A society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit.” When we dispose of radioactive waste, we don’t say, “Who cares if this poisons people centuries from now?” Similarly, few of us who care about climate change or pollution do so solely for the sake of people alive today. We build museums and parks and bridges that we hope will last for generations; we invest in schools and longterm scientific projects; we preserve paintings, traditions, languages; we protect beautiful places. In many cases, we don’t draw clear lines between our concerns for the present and the future ― both are in play. * radioactive: 방사선의 ①How to Be Present: Discover the Benefits of Here and Now ②The Power of Time Management: The Key to Success ③Why Is Green Infrastructure Eventually Cost­Effective? ④Solving Present­Day Problems from Past Experiences ⑤How We Act Beyond the Bounds of Time 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Ilya Prigogine에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Ilya Prigogine was born into a Jewish family in Moscow. In 1921, he and his family left Russia, eventually settling in Belgium. His parents encouraged him to become a lawyer, and he first studied law at the Free University of Brussels. It was then that he became interested in psychology and behavioral research. In turn, reading about these subjects sparked his interest in chemistry since chemical processes affect the mind and body. He eventually dropped out of law school. Prigogine then studied chemistry and physics at the same time at the Free University of Brussels. He obtained the equivalent of a master’s degree in both fields in 1939, and he obtained a PhD in chemistry in 1941 at the Free University of Brussels, where he accepted the position of professor in 1947. Considered one of the founders of complexity science, Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. * equivalent: 상응하는 것 ①1921년에 그와 그의 가족은 러시아를 떠났다. ②부모님은 그가 변호사가 되기를 권했다. ③Free University of Brussels에서 화학과 물리학을 동시에 공부했다. ④1941년에 Free University of Brussels의 교수직을 수락했다. ⑤1977년에 노벨 화학상을 수상했다. 27.

The process of crossing cultures challenges the very basis of who we are as cultural beings. It offers opportunities for new learning and growth. Being “uprooted” from our home ①brings us understanding not only of the people and their culture in our new environment, but of ourselves and our home culture. Although the difficulties that can arise from crossing cultures are often shocking, success stories are everywhere. Despite, or rather because of, the suffering and ambivalence we undergo when we cross cultures, we gradually find ourselves ②uniquely privileged to define ourselves and others anew with clarity and insight that we could not have cultivated without leaving home. ③Adapting to a new and unfamiliar culture, then, is more than survival. It is a life­changing journey. It is a process of “becoming” — personal reinvention, transformation, growth, reaching out beyond the boundaries of our own existence. The process does not require that we abandon our former personalities and the cultures ④which we were born. Rather, it compels us to find ⑤ourselves as if for the first time, particularly those “cultural invariants” within us — aspects that we hold dear and refuse to compromise. * ambivalence: 상반되는 감정, 모순 30. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? While it has been found that young children rely exclusively on geometric information to determine the location of an object hidden in a small enclosure, exclusive use of geometry does not occur in larger spaces. Although, in a small room, children ①failed to incorporate information about nongeometric features (i.e., a blue wall), they used both types of information in a larger room. These findings suggest that geometric and nongeometric information may be combined in a ②weighted fashion. Geometry may be ③invalid because it is more stable across time than is nongeometric information. Whether or not nongeometric landmark information is combined with geometry may depend on the ecological validity of nongeometric features; for example, larger features may be more stable and hence more ④reliable.

It has been a privilege to serve in this company for the past four years. The experiences and insights I have gained as a safety manager have been invaluable. However, after careful consideration, I have accepted a position at another company and will be leaving Lewis Ltd.

The piece of wreckage Anna held on to that served as a life preserver had a window. Now that there was light, she looked through it and down into the water. She wished she hadn’t. She spied dark shapes moving beneath her. What could they be? Fish? Sharks? Anna shook with fear, her blood running cold. The last bits of strength were draining away from her arms and upper body. She did not know how much longer she could hang on, but then Anna glanced up and couldn’t believe what she saw. A fishing boat was approaching over the big waves. After being in the water for 3 hours, she was finally rescued. When she got on the boat, she felt a sense of relief spread through her body. ① eager → sorrowful ② terrified → relieved ③ excited → confused ④ indifferent → irritated ⑤ confident → ashamed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? By definition, adult learners have a self­concept of being in charge of their own lives and have a need to be seen and treated as being capable of taking responsibility for their own learning. As such, learners need to be given the freedom and autonomy to assume responsibility for their own choices and to be proactive in making decisions that contribute to their educational experiences. Rather than perform the role of the “sage on the stage,” in working with adult learners, the instructor’s role should be the “guide on the side” — a facilitator of learning, and a coach or mentor who works alongside their learners to promote achievement and academic success. The facilitator role extends beyond course delivery, and includes the broader pedagogical tasks that will support learners on their growth such as helping them effectively manage their time; fostering engagement; assigning meaningful and relevant learning activities; and so on. * autonomy: 자율성, 자주성 ** sage: 현자 *** pedagogical: 교육적인 ①학 생 들 의 성 취 도 를 측 정 할 수 있 는 객 관 적 인 평 가 도 구 를 개 발 해 야 한 다 . ②성인 학습자를 가르치는 교사는 촉진자의 역할을 수행해야 한다. ③교사는 지식 전달을 최우선으로 하여 수업을 진행해야 한다. ④교사는 학생들의 연령에 상관없이 시각 자료를 활용해야 한다. ⑤성인 학습자는 새로운 것을 배울 때 더 많은 시간을 투자해야 한다. 고3 21. 다음 밑줄 친 you taste its price가 의미하는 바로 가장 적절 한 것은? That perception is a construction is not true just of one’s perception of sensory input, such as visual and auditory information. It is true of your social perceptions as well ― your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine’s taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn’t because the subjects consciously believed that the higher­priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn’t true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That’s related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don’t just taste the wine; you taste its price. ①Customer ratings determine the price of a product. ②We fool ourselves into thinking our unplanned buying was reasonable. ③We immediately dismiss opposing opinions without any consideration. ④The brain shows consistent response regardless of personal preference. ⑤The perceived value of a product influences one’s subjective experience of it. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Though it may seem extreme, a multilingual can quite literally feel differently about people, events or things when using one language versus another. The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well­being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true ― the second language is associated with post­immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language. * rattle: 당황하게하다 ** connotation: 함축(된 의미) *** persecution: 박해 ①다중 언어 환경은 모국어 학습 발달을 지연시킨다. ②모국어 실력이 뛰어날수록 외국어를 습득하는 속도가 빠르다. ③다중 언어 사용자는 사용하는 언어에 따라 다르게 느끼고 반응한다. ④부정적인 어휘가 긍정적인 어휘보다 감정에 미치는 영향이 크다. ⑤긍정적인 감정을 나타내는 어휘량이 문화권마다 다르다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Sociologist Brooke Harrington said if there was an  of social science, it would be SD > PD, “social death is more frightening than physical death.” This is why we feel deeply threatened when a new idea challenges the ones that have become part of our identity. For some ideas, the ones that identify us as members of a group, we don’t reason as individuals; we reason as a member of a tribe. We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that’s the one you will pick. * innate: 타고난 ① tendency to prefer the group that one identifies with ② necessity of social isolation to build a reputation ③ ways to ease one’s irrational fear of crowds ④ importance of forming groups with different interests ⑤ tips for staying objective during heated group discussions 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Distance in time is like distance in space. People matter even if they live thousands of miles away. Likewise, they matter even if they live thousands of years hence. In both cases, it’s easy to mistake distance for unreality, to treat the limits of what we can see as the limits of the world. But just as the world does not stop at our doorstep or our country’s borders, neither does it stop with our generation, or the next. These ideas are common sense. A popular proverb says, “A society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit.” When we dispose of radioactive waste, we don’t say, “Who cares if this poisons people centuries from now?” Similarly, few of us who care about climate change or pollution do so solely for the sake of people alive today. We build museums and parks and bridges that we hope will last for generations; we invest in schools and longterm scientific projects; we preserve paintings, traditions, languages; we protect beautiful places. In many cases, we don’t draw clear lines between our concerns for the present and the future ― both are in play. * radioactive: 방사선의 ①How to Be Present: Discover the Benefits of Here and Now ②The Power of Time Management: The Key to Success ③Why Is Green Infrastructure Eventually Cost­Effective? ④Solving Present­Day Problems from Past Experiences ⑤How We Act Beyond the Bounds of Time 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

It is true of your social perceptions as well ―your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine’s taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn’t because the subjects consciously believed that the higher­priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn’t true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That’s related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don’t just taste the wine; you taste its price.①Customer ratings determine the price of a product.②We fool ourselves into thinking our unplanned buying was reasonable.③We immediately dismiss opposing opinions without any consideration.④The brain shows consistent response regardless of personal preference.⑤The perceived value of a product influences one’s subjective experience of it."

The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well­being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true ― the second language is associated with post­immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love.

For some ideas, the ones that identify us as members of a group, we don’t reason as individuals; we reason as a member of a tribe. We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that’s the one you will pick.* innate: 타고난① tendency to prefer the group that one identifies with② necessity of social isolation to build a reputation③ ways to ease one’s irrational fear of crowds④ importance of forming groups with different interests⑤ tips for staying objective during heated group discussions"

But just as the world does not stop at our doorstep or our country’s borders, neither does it stop with our generation, or the next. These ideas are common sense. A popular proverb says, “A society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit.” When we dispose of radioactive waste, we don’t say, “Who cares if this poisons people centuries from now?” Similarly, few of us who care about climate change or pollution do so solely for the sake of people alive today. We build museums and parks and bridges that we hope will last for generations; we invest in schools and longterm scientific projects; we preserve paintings, traditions, languages; we protect beautiful places.

Prigogine then studied chemistry and physics at the same time at the Free University of Brussels. He obtained the equivalent of a master’s degree in both fields in 1939, and he obtained a PhD in chemistry in 1941 at the Free University of Brussels, where he accepted the position of professor in 1947.

The commonsense understanding of the moral status of altruistic acts conforms to how most of us think about our responsibilities toward others. We tend to get offended when someone else or society determines for us how much of what we have should be given away; we are adults and should have the right to make such decisions for ourselves. Yet, when interviewed, altruists known for making the largest sacrifices — and bringing about the greatest benefits to their recipients — assert just the opposite. They insist that they . Organ donors, and everyday citizens who risk their own lives to save others in mortal danger are remarkably consistent in their explicit denials that they have done anything deserving of high praise as well as in their assurance that anyone in their shoes should have done exactly the same thing. To be sure, it seems that the more altruistic someone is, the more they are likely to insist that they have done no more than all of us would be expected to do, lest we shirk our basic moral obligation to humanity. * altruistic: 이타적인 ** lest: ~하지 않도록 *** shirk: (책임을) 회피하다 ① had absolutely no choice but to act as they did ② should have been rewarded financially ③ regretted making such decisions ④ deserved others’ appreciation in return ⑤ found the moral obligations inapplicable in risky situations 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. Epictetus wrote, “A man’s master is he who is able to confirm or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns.” If you depend on no one except yourself to satisfy your desires, you will have no master other than yourself and you will be free. Stoic philosophy was about that ― taking charge of your life, learning to work on those things that are within your power to accomplish or change and not to waste energy on things you cannot. In particular, the Stoics warned against . Often, Epictetus argued, it’s not our circumstances that get us down but rather the judgments we make about them. Consider anger. We don’t get angry at the rain if it spoils our picnic. That would be silly because we can’t do anything about the rain. But we often do get angry if someone mistreats us. We usually can’t control or change that person any more than we can stop the rain, so that is equally silly. More generally, it is just as pointless to tie our feelings of well­being to altering another individual’s behavior as it is to tie them to the weather. Epictetus wrote, “If it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.” * shun: 피하다 ** the Stoics: 스토아학파 ①making an argument without enough evidence ②listening to others’ opinions without judgment ③reacting emotionally to what is outside your control ④pretending to have comprehended when you have not ⑤rationalizing to yourself that the situation is out of control 34. Japanese used to have a color word, ao, that spanned both green and blue. In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists’ palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese. Rather than alter the name to fit reality, the Japanese government announced in 1973 that : henceforth, go lights would be a color that better corresponded to the dominant meaning of ao. * parlance: 용어 ① reality should be altered to fit the name ② language reflected what people had in mind ③ the go light should follow the global standard ④ the use of the word ao for go light would be banned ⑤ they would not change the color of go light in any way 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? No doubt students collaborating with other speakers of English might encounter language variances, which may interfere with intentionality. ①To address such disparities, Horner, Lu, Royster, and Trimbur (2011) call for a “translingual approach” in which language varieties are not perceived as barriers, but as avenues for meaning making. ②Similarly, Galloway and Rose (2015) study of Global Englishes found that exposure to other Englishes helps normalize language differences. ③Educators have to work with students to examine phrases, expressions, and other ranges of English language use for their rhetorical and communicative possibilities and not their perceived errors or inferior status. ④Committing an error means unintentionally saying what isn’t true, so any linguistic or perspective error should be avoided at all cost. ⑤After all, students are constantly reading texts and listening to speakers whose Englishes do not necessarily conform to what is considered standard in their own communities. * disparity: 차이 ** rhetorical: 수사적인 *** inferior: 열등한",

Japanese used to have a color word, ao, that spanned both green and blue.

Different creative pursuits require varying degrees of unconscious flexible thinking, in combination with varying degrees of the conscious ability to adjust it and shape it through analytical thinking. In music, for example, at one end of the creative spectrum are improvisational artists, such as jazz musicians. (A) On the other end of the spectrum are those who compose complex forms, such as a symphony or concerto, that require not just imagination but also careful planning and exacting editing. We know, for example, through his letters and the reports of others, that even Mozart’s creations did not appear spontaneously, wholly formed in his consciousness, as the myths about him portray.

Today, historic ideas about integrating nature and urban/suburban space find expression in various interpretations of sustainable urban planning. (A) But Landscape Urbanists find that these designs do not prioritize the natural environment and often involve diverting streams and disrupting natural wetlands. Still others, such as those advocating for “just sustainabilities” or “complete streets,” find that both approaches are overly idealistic and neither pays enough attention to the realities of social dynamics and systemic inequality. (B) However, critics claim that Landscape Urbanists prioritize aesthetic and ecological concerns over human needs. In contrast, New Urbanism is an approach that was popularized in the 1980s and promotes walkable streets, compact design, and mixed­use developments. (C) However, the role of social justice in these approaches remains highly controversial. For example, Landscape Urbanism is a relatively recent planning approach that advocates for native habitat designs that include diverse species and landscapes that require very low resource use. * compact: 고밀도, 촘촘한 ** divert: 우회시키다, 방향을 바꾸게 하다 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",

Different creative pursuits require varying degrees of unconscious flexible thinking, in combination with varying degrees of the conscious ability to adjust it and shape it through analytical thinking. In music, for example, at one end of the creative spectrum are improvisational artists, such as jazz musicians. (A) On the other end of the spectrum are those who compose complex forms, such as a symphony or concerto, that require not just imagination but also careful planning and exacting editing. We know, for example, through his letters and the reports of others, that even Mozart’s creations did not appear spontaneously, wholly formed in his consciousness, as the myths about him portray. (B) They have to be particularly talented at lowering their inhibitions and letting in their unconsciously generated ideas.
