Anxious, Susan said, “Well... why not get the pizza and bring it home to eat?” “No!” said Carrie, sixteen at the time. “Other people eat at the pizza place, and I want to, too!” Susan was concerned, but said okay, and Carrie went off by herself a block or two away. After a while, Carrie came back, grinning. “You made it! What made you want to do this?” Susan asked. Carrie had seen her friend Izzy on TV talking about his subway ride. “I thought if he could do it, I could do it too.” Susan’s heart swelled, realizing her daughter was braver and much more grown­up than she thought.",

Multiple studies show that anxiety is markedly reduced, and we gain benefits similar to solitude, not by simply turning our phones off but by having them not physically with us. If a phone is essential for safety during time alone, then turn off alerts, cover the screen —just tape paper right over it —and keep it somewhere that is terribly inconvenient to access. I am always surprised by how long it takes me to give up the impulse to reach for my phone, often for no reason at all, other than to “just check.” Check what  Always it is something that can do without me for the moment.

Adults use what they learned as children to mate, hunt, and generally succeed as grown­ups in that environment. Children are the R&D (research and development) department of the human species. We grown­ups are production and marketing. We start out as brilliantly flexible but helpless and dependent babies, great at learning everything but terrible at doing just about anything.

Urban infrastructure projects need to address the trade­offs between conservation, livelihoods, and equitable distribution of resources. Historically there has been tension when conservation models that create protected areas are perceived as inaccessible to communities. Often, these models are implemented at the expense of poor and marginalized residents and users of resources from the areas. Social, economic, and environmental development programs have become obstacles to sustainable development because there is no balance between the need to protect ecosystem services and the desire to use resources to address community needs. Communities need to be allowed to identify and negotiate their own options and to increase their flexibility to cope with unexpected change.* equitable: 공평한",

        "paragraph": "Melody is one of the primary ways that our expectations are controlled by composers. Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping­off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap. * adjacent: 인접한",

She dropped out of high school to pursue a full­time acting career and, at 17, she played her first leading role in The Toll of the Sea. Reviewers praised her extraordinary acting but her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from casting her as a leading lady. Frustrated, Wong left for Europe in 1928, where she had main roles in many notable films. When American studios wanted fresh European talent in the 1930s, Wong’s new prestige immediately led to a main role on Broadway. She returned to America and used her influence to advocate for better film opportunities for Chinese­Americans. In 1938, she sold her movie costumes and donated the money from the sale to organizations supporting Chinese refugees. During World War II, she gave political speeches against the anti­Asian attitudes in the U.S. In 2022, she became the first Asian American to appear on U.S. currency ― a century after she landed her first leading role.",

Conceptual artists decoupled the relationship between the art object and artist by mitigating all personal signs of invention. The artist became detached from the idea of personalized draftsmanship by installing a predetermined system ― a type of instruction for another to follow. That way there was, as Sol LeWitt states, no “dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.” Effectively any person could carry out the instructions. The same process was at work in computer art, where artists devised a predetermined drawing algorithm for the computer automaton to carry out the instruction. The human agent initiated the conceptual form, and a machine actuated it. Likewise, the computer artwork lacked any autographic mark, trace of spontaneity, or artistic authenticity. The plotter arm would replace the human arm in the production process. [3점]* mitigate: 완화하다  ** actuate: 작동시키다 *** plotter: 플로터(데이터를 도면화하는 출력 장치)",

Behaviors used to kill or consume food can be the same in any environment. Ernst Mayr, an evolutionary biologist, called these different behavioral systems “open” or “closed” to the effects of experience. A lion hunting her prey is an example of an open system. The hunting female lion recognizes her prey from a distance and approaches it carefully. Charles Herrick, a neurobiologist, wrote, “the details of the hunt vary every time she hunts. Therefore no combination of simple reflex arcs laid down in the nervous system will be adequate to meet the infinite variations of the requirements for obtaining food.” [3점]* scavenge: 동물의 사체를 찾아 다니다 ** reflex arc: 반사궁(충격이 통과하여 반사를 형성하는 신경 경로)",

        "question": "37 In the course of acquiring a language, children are exposed to only a finite set of utterances. Yet they come to use and understand an infinite set of sentences. (A) Yet, they all arrive at pretty much the same grammar. The input that children get is haphazard in the sense that caretakers do not talk to their children to illustrate a particular point of grammar. Yet, all children develop systematic knowledge of a language. (B) Thus, despite the severe limitations and variation in the input children receive, and also in their personal circumstances, they all develop a rich and uniform system of linguistic knowledge. The knowledge attained goes beyond the input in various ways. (C) This has been referred to as the creative aspect of language use. This ‘creativity’ does not refer to the ability to write poetry or novels but rather the ability to produce and understand an unlimited set of new sentences never spoken or heard previously. The precise linguistic input children receive differs from child to child; no two children are exposed to exactly the same set of utterances. [3점]* haphazard: 무작위적인, 되는 대로의",

Humans likely evolved to co­sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night people in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning people, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That’s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait — here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up —that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount.
