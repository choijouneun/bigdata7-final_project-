Information is extracted or learned from these sources of data, and this captured information is then transformed into knowledge that is eventually used to trigger actions or decisions.

The liquid nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to materials. But dematerialization is not just about digital goods.

The tangible is replaced by intangibles ― intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity ― that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if .

        "question": "34 Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over time. The negative version instructs restraint; the positive encourages intervention. One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior. While examples of these rules abound, too many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and “Love another as yourself.” Both versions insist on caring for others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or through acts of commission, by actively intervening. Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, they . The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self-referential. Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated. [3점]* an other: 타자(他者)",

        "question": "36 Notation was more than a practical method for preserving an expanding repertoire of music. (A) Written notes freeze the music rather than allowing it to develop in the hands of individuals, and it discourages improvisation. Partly because of notation, modern classical performance lacks the depth of nuance that is part of aural tradition. Before notation arrived, in all history music was largely carried on as an aural tradition. (B) It changed the nature of the art itself. To write something down means that people far away in space and time can re-create it. At the same time, there are downsides. (C) Most world music is still basically aural, including sophisticated musical traditions such as Indian and Balinese. Most jazz musicians can read music but often don’t bother, and their art is much involved with improvisation. Many modern pop musicians, one example being Paul McCartney, can’t read music at all.* improvisation: 즉흥 연주 ** aural: 청각의",

But then, in a decade or so, some governments, industries, educational institutions, and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner.
