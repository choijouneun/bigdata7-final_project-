The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it  A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.”",

And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates.

Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner.

After being denied several times, she was accepted into a training program in anesthesiology. As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies. During this time, she developed the Apgar score, which is a method of checking the health of a newborn. According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies.

That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others.

The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non­selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition.

        "paragraph": "(A) And because birders are human, these birding memories― like most human memories ― improve over time. The colors of the plumages become richer, the songs sweeter, and those elusive field marks more vivid and distinct in retrospect.(B) The key to comprehending the passion of birding is to realize that bird­watching is really a hunt. But unlike hunting, the trophies you accumulate are in your mind.(C) Of course, your mind is a great place to populate with them because you carry them around with you wherever you go. You don’t leave them to gather dust on a wall or up in the attic. Your birding experiences become part of your life, part of who you are. * plumage: 깃털 ** in retrospect: 돌이켜 생각해 보면",

        "question": "37 Distinct from the timing of interaction is the way in which time is compressed on television. Specifically, the pauses and delays that characterize everyday life are removed through editing, and new accents are added ―namely, a laugh track. (A) It is the statement that is in bold print or the boxed insert in newspaper and magazine articles. As such, compression techniques accentuate another important temporal dimension of television ― rhythm and tempo.(B) More important, television performers, or people who depend on television, such as politicians, are evaluated by viewers (voters) on their ability to meet time compression requirements, such as the one sentence graphic statement or metaphor to capture the moment.(C) The familiar result is a compressed event in which action flows with rapid ease, compacting hours or even days into minutes, and minutes into seconds. Audiences are spared the waiting common to everyday life. Although this use of time may appear unnatural in the abstract, the television audience has come to expect it, and critics demand it.

Correcting the students requires a high level of sensitivity on the part of the teacher. It does not mean that there is no need to correct, but the correction should not lead to silencing the student. An authoritarian form of correction often prompts even the very brightest of students to withdraw from an uncomfortable situation, let alone those students who are less secure about their own intellectual potential. It also kills the willingness to entertain more risky interpretations. Instead of simply accepting any interpretation just for the sake of the freedom of expression, it is most advisable to question the student about how he/she arrived at their interpretation. This approach creates a community of thinkers, who demonstrate that what is at stake is not the superiority of the opinion based on the hierarchy of the author, but a realization that we belong together in our investigating the matter in question.The teacher’s intellectual authority should be exercised carefully without making individual students (A) and in a way that encourages them to share their own (B) .(A)(B)",

        "text": "Clinical psychologists sometimes say that two kinds of people seek therapy: those who need tightening, and those who need loosening. But for every patient seeking help in becoming more organized, self­controlled, and responsible about her future, there is a waiting room full of people (a) hoping to loosen up, lighten up, and worry less about the stupid things they said at yesterday’s staff meeting or about the rejection they are sure will follow tomorrow’s lunch date. For most people, their subconscious sees too many things as bad and not enough as good. It makes sense. If you were designing the mind of a fish, would you have it respond as strongly to opportunities as to threats? No way. The cost of missing a cue that signals food is (b) low; odds are that there are other fish in the sea, and one mistake won’t lead to starvation. The cost of missing the sign of a nearby (c) predator, however, can be catastrophic. Game over, end of the line for those genes. Of course, evolution has no designer, but minds created by natural selection end up looking (to us) as though they were (d) designed because they generally produce behavior that is flexibly adaptive in their ecological niches. Some commonalities of animal life even create similarities across species that we might call design principles. One such principle is that bad is (e) weaker than good.
