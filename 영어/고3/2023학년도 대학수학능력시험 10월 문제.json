I must have been visibly upset because a woman came over, took my arm, and led me to the street. She called a taxi and gave the driver a five­dollar bill. She told him to take me to the ferry terminal, because the bus made a stop there before heading out onto the highway. She also wished me a Merry Christmas, and all I could do was smile.

Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading.

Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing.

In German, bridge (die brücke) is a feminine noun; in Spanish, bridge (el puente) is a masculine noun. Boroditsky found that when asked to describe a bridge, native German speakers used words like beautiful, elegant, slender. When native Spanish speakers were asked the same question, they used words like strong, sturdy, towering. (B) According to Stanford University psychology professor Lera Boroditsky, that’s not necessarily so. Focusing on the grammatical gender differences between German and Spanish, Boroditsky’s work indicates that the gender our language assigns to a given noun influences us to subconsciously give that noun characteristics of the grammatical gender. (C) This worked the other way around as well. The word key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. When asked to describe a key, native German speakers used words like jagged, heavy, hard, metal. Spanish speakers used words like intricate, golden, lovely.* jagged: 뾰족뾰족한 ** intricate: 정교한",

And, according to the confirmation effect, we blindly trust the reality we construct.(A) You will see that the majority of us are quite ignorant about what lies around us. This is not so puzzling. The most extraordinary fact is that we completely disregard this ignorance.(B) This is best witnessed in visual illusions, which we perceive with full confidence, as if there were no doubt that we are portraying reality faithfully. One interesting way of discovering this — in a simple game that can be played at any moment — is the following.

        "paragraph": "Music has no past; it exists only at the moment when it happens, and no two performances are identical. This is music’s greatest asset because it brings out the essential ‘now’ without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to ‘realize the present.’ Musical ‘meaning’ cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present­ing music — making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all — does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music. Yet, in spite of numerous attempts to develop a more musical music curriculum for the majority of school pupils, the emphasis is still on pupils absorbing factual information about music. Music’s quality of being in the present is (A) in formal music education, where delivering factual knowledge is (B).(A) (B)",
