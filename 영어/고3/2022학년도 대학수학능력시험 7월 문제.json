Even after the installation of road traffic safety facilities, we still need more for the safety of our students. It is a problem with the school road, which students use on their way to and from school. The width of the current school road is barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. So, there are risks of collision with vehicles on the road where students walk and accidents if many students flock to the narrow school road. Therefore, we ask you to expand the school road for students’ safety. I would appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible.Sincerely, Alisha Lee",

The fields were rough, with only the slightest trail to follow. Along the way there were small trenches dug in the fields. I never figured out why. As we got closer and closer to the top of the hill, I was actually becoming scared, which was kind of rare, because at that age I was pretty fearless. As we got to the top of the hill, there was a loud thump! My truck sunk down like something heavy had just jumped in the bed. We were too terrified to look in the back. I panicked and decided to throw the truck into reverse and back down the hill. As I did so, there was another thump and a loud roar now came out like I’d never, ever heard before.",

Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me  Will the joy be temporary or long­lasting  Will the purchase be something I can share with others  If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short­term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer­term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount. Maybe you’d enjoy a concert with friends or a dinner cruise during the summer. Once you think of an experience you’d enjoy, seriously consider diverting the money for the purchase from possession to experience.",

The sacrifice was worth the gain; there would be no regrets. Yet it has become apparent that this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse. Its swelling flanks hid the impositions of a new type of enslavement. The automatons are not as autonomous as advertised. They need us. Those computers that were supposed to do our calculations for us instead demand our attention: for ten hours a day, we are glued to their screens. Our communications monopolize our time. Time itself is accelerating. The complexity of the system overwhelms us. And leisure is often a costly distraction. * flank: 측면, 옆구리  ** automaton: 자동 장치",

        "paragraph": "Giving honest information may be particularly relevant to integrity because honesty is so fundamental in discussions of trustworthiness. Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior.",

Yet each is a perfect example of human capacities that were essential to our having prevailed. The link between scientific aptitude and solving real­world challenges may be more apparent, but minds that reason with analogy and metaphor, minds that represent with color and texture, minds that imagine with melody and rhythm are minds that . Which is all just to say that the arts may well have been vital for developing the flexibility of thought and fluency of intuition that our relatives needed to fashion the spear, to invent cooking, to harness the wheel, and, later, to write the Mass in B Minor and, later still, to crack our rigid perspective on space and time. Across hundreds of thousands of years, artistic endeavors may have been the playground of human cognition, providing a safe arena for training our imaginative capacities and infusing them with a potent faculty for innovation.

        "question": "36 It raises much less reactance to tell people what to do than to tell them what not to do. Therefore, advocating action should lead to higher compliance than prohibiting action. (A) This is a prescription that is rife with danger, failing to provide an implementation rule and raising reactance. Much better is to say, “To help make sure that other people provide answers as useful as yours have been, when people ask you about this study, please tell them that you and another person answered some questions about each other.” (B) For example, researchers have a choice of how to debrief research participants in an experiment involving some deception or omission of information. Often researchers attempt to commit the participant to silence, saying “Please don’t tell other potential participants that feedback from the other person was false.” (C) Similarly, I once saw a delightful and unusual example of this principle at work in an art gallery. A fragile acrylic sculpture had a sign at the base saying, “Please touch with your eyes.” The command was clear, yet created much less reactance in me than “Don’t touch!” would have.

Earliest indications of the need for inspiration for fashion direction are possibly evidenced by a number of British manufacturers visiting the United States in around 1825 where they were much inspired by lightweight wool blend fabrics produced for outerwear.

One big problem with exercise is that we don’t track it very scrupulously. A study in America found that people overestimated the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off. As Daniel Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker —equivalent to more than sixty marathons. That’s pretty impressive, but here’s a reasonable question: how many factory workers look as if they run a marathon every six days? To be cruelly blunt, not many. That’s because most of them, like most of the rest of us, replace all those burnt calories, and then some, when they are not working.* scrupulously: 용의주도하게  Losing weight is hard because people usually think they burned a (A) number of calories than they actually did and (B) exercise by eating a lot of food.
