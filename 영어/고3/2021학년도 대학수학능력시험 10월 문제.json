        "paragraph": "Two independent research groups have discovered that we have “confusion at the frontier” when we search the Internet. Adrian Ward, a psychologist at the University of Texas, found that engaging in Internet searches increased people’s cognitive self­esteem, their sense of their own ability to remember and process information. Moreover, people who searched the Internet for facts they didn’t know and were later asked where they found the information often misremembered and reported that they had known it all along. Many of them completely forgot ever having conducted the search. They gave themselves the credit instead of the Internet. In a different set of studies, researchers found that those who had searched the Internet to answer specific questions rated their ability to answer unrelated questions as higher than those who had not. The act of searching the Internet and finding answers to one set of questions caused the participants to increase their sense that they knew the answers to all questions, including those whose answers they had not researched.",

        "paragraph": "A visual scene can set up our emotional response. Suspense is driven by a sense of calm with the anticipation of impending terror. Indeed, anticipation or expectations play a key role in driving our emotions. The Russian silent filmmaker Lev Kuleshov considered such contextual influences. He interspersed shots of an actor exhibiting a neutral expression with shots of a child’s coffin or a plate of soup. This same “neutral” expression was interpreted differently depending on what image preceded it. Thus, the same expression appeared to show sorrow or hunger, depending on the context. Psychological studies of the Kuleshov effect have confirmed the impact of the social context on emotion. For example, if a person smiles at you and then the smile turns into a neutral expression, that person will appear somewhat grumpy or disappointed. Conversely, if a person first looks angry and then the expression turns into a neutral expression, the person looks somewhat pleasant or positive.* intersperse: (~ 사이에) 배치하다 ** grumpy: 기분이 언짢은",

However, efforts are on to have a built environment in which loss of life is minimized, and lifelines and infrastructure continue to function during and after an earthquake disaster. Construction activities in seismically prone and hazardous areas that are vulnerable to different damaging effects of earthquakes are best avoided. Most of the time such situations are unavoidable; in that case appropriate strengthening measures are required. Structures should be preferably made on firm ground. For construction in soft soil, the ground should be strengthened, and the foundations should be sufficiently deep, wide, and strong.

Moreover, they tend to form spontaneously; when like­minded people find each other, a group emerges. The improvisational collaboration of the entire group translates moments of individual creativity into group innovation. Allowing the space for this self­organizing emergence to occur is difficult for many managers because the outcome isn’t controlled by the management team’s agenda and is therefore less predictable. Most business executives like to start with the big picture and then work out the details. That’s why so many of the best examples of improvised innovation take place outside of formal organizations. In improvisational innovation, teams start with the details and then work up to the big picture.

Toys that appear to be alive are curiosities because they challenge how we think inanimate objects and living things should behave.

Tell them how you get frustrated and bored with this job.(A) These stories will make them realise that you are meant to follow your passion. At times they need to be surprised with your small achievements, which could be some additional skills you acquired, or some awards you won in your field of passion.(B) Discuss this almost twice a week. Then start doing work related to your passion on the side and let them see and experience how happy you are while doing this. Find a way to get your family and friends involved in your passion. The more they see you doing your passion, the more they connect with you emotionally.(C) Tell them stories of how you are inspired by the passion and how it makes a difference not only to you but also to others. Give examples of how someone living a similar passion started his or her life and today how he or she is living happily.",

        "question": "37 Living in dispersal correlates with a shocking retreat from public life, according to extensive analysis of the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey of nearly thirty thousand people begun in 2000. It is hard to pinpoint the origin of this retreat.(A) Meanwhile, the architectures of sprawl inhibit political activity that requires face­to­face interaction. It is not that sprawl makes political activity impossible, but by privatizing gathering space and dispersing human activity, sprawl makes political gathering less likely.(B) These are both possible, but evidence suggests that the spatial landscape matters. Sociologists point out that the suburbs have done an efficient job of sorting people into communities where they will be surrounded by people of the same socioeconomic status.(C) It may be because people in the dispersed city have invested so heavily in private comfort that they feel insulated from the problems of the rest of the world. It may be that sprawl has attracted people who are naturally less interested in engaging with the world, socially or politically. [3점]* sprawl: 스프롤(무질서하게 뻗어 나간 도시 외곽 지역)",

        "paragraph": "Perhaps not surprisingly, given how long magicians have been developing their craft, a lot of creativity in magic is of the tweaking variety ─some of the most skilled and inventive magicians gained fame by refining the execution of tricks that have been known for decades, or sometimes centuries. Nevil Maskelyne, one of magic’s old masters, claimed that “the difficulty of producing a new magical effect is about equivalent to that of inventing a new proposition in Euclid.” Whether it’s because there’s little that’s completely new, or for some other reason, magicians seem to worry less about imitation. They do, however, worry a lot about traitors ─those magicians who expose the secrets behind a trick to the public. Once a trick is exposed in this way, its value as “magic” is destroyed, and this harms everyone in the industry. For this reason, magicians’ norms are focused mostly on punishing magicians who expose tricks to the public ─even if the trick is the exposer’s own invention.* tweak: 살짝 변화를 주다 ** traitor: 배신자Magicians, having long refined existing tricks, are not much worried about (A) tricks, but they are very strict about (B) the methods of tricks as it damages their industry.(A)(B)",
