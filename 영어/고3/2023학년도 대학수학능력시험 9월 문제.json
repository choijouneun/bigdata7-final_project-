        "paragraph": "Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up.* vulnerability: 취약성",

Multiculturalists suggest that there should be a model of partial assimilation in which immigrants retain some of their customs, beliefs, and language. There is pressure to conform rather than to maintain their cultural identities, however, and these conflicts are greatly determined by the community to which one migrates. These experiences are not new; many Europeans experienced exclusion and poverty during the first two waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eventually, these immigrants transformed this country with significant changes that included enlightenment and acceptance of diversity. People of color, however, continue to struggle for acceptance. Once again, the challenge is to recognize that other cultures think and act differently and that they have the right to do so. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, immigrants will no longer be strangers among us.",

        "paragraph": "The primary purpose of commercial music radio broadcasting is to deliver an audience to a group of advertisers and sponsors. To achieve commercial success, that audience must be as large as possible. More than any other characteristics (such as demographic or psychographic profile, purchasing power, level of interest, degree of satisfaction, quality of attention or emotional state), the quantity of an audience aggregated as a mass is the most significant metric for broadcasters seeking to make music radio for profitable ends. As a result, broadcasters attempt to maximise their audience size by playing music that is popular, or ― at the very least ― music that can be relied upon not to cause audiences to switch off their radio or change the station. Audience retention is a key value (if not the key value) for many music programmers and for radio station management. In consequence, a high degree of risk aversion frequently marks out the ‘successful’ radio music programmer. Playlists are restricted, and often very small.* aggregate: 모으다** aversion: 싫어함",

The general accessibility of archives has greatly extended the shelf life of journalism, with older stories now regularly cited to provide context for more current ones.

One of the emergent qualities of online news, determined in part by the depth of readily accessible online archives, seems to be the possibility of understanding news stories as the manifest outcomes of larger economic, social and cultural issues rather than short-lived and unconnected media spectacles.* archive: 기록 보관소** musty: 곰팡내 나는*** manifest: 분명한",

In 1951, the year he earned his doctoral degree in French literature at Princeton University, Rosen made both his New York piano debut and his first recordings. To glowing praise, he appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral concerts around the world. Rosen’s performances impressed some of the 20th century’s most well-known composers, who invited him to play their music. Rosen was also the author of many widely admired books about music. His most famous book, The Classical Style, was first published in 1971 and won the U.S. National Book Award the next year. This work, which was reprinted in an expanded edition in 1997, remains a landmark in the field. While writing extensively, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life until he died in 2012.",

Soon this led to the construction of better highways and freeways and the decline and even loss of public transportation. With all of these changes came a of leisure.

Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t . It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street.",

Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism’s arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations ... achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass- produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images.

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never ― for lack of archives ― been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.󰀻While historical fiction reconstructs the past using (A)evidence, it provides an inviting description, which may(B)people’s understanding of historical events.(A)(B)(A)(B)",
