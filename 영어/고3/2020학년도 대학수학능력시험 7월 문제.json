As a non­profit organization, the school will be run only on your contributions and resources as gifts to the children we hope to help. Our outline of the school is at a primitive stage currently, and its execution and extension are hugely dependent on your donations. These children that we hope to help are often seen working in factories and cafes due to their family’s financial difficulties. It is a great disappointment that such a young population of our community is wasted and cannot see the light of education. Kindly look at our plan on our website www.dreamproject.com and donate at your convenience. We hope that you will be a part of our project and look forward to further support and encouragement.

        "paragraph": "In recent years I’ve come to see that, amazingly, the key to almost all of our problems is faulty storytelling, because it’s storytelling that drives the way we gather and spend our energy. I believe that stories ― not the ones people tell us but the ones we tell ourselves ― determine nothing less than our personal and professional destinies. And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best ― and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story ― the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t ― it shouldn’t and won’t ―be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary. After all, you’re not just the author of your story but also its main character, the hero. Heroes are never ordinary. * scrutinize: 면밀히 조사하다  ** paleontologist: 고생물학자",

        "paragraph": "A question can be raised about the basic notion that sensitivity to problems is critical in setting the creative process in motion. It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to.",

From 1905, he began a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian Zoltán Kodály in trying to popularize Hungarian folk songs and gained a practical knowledge of string writing from both folk and classical musicians. Bartók had a successful career as a pianist, performing throughout Europe and in the United States with musicians such as the jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman.

        "question": "36 The reason why any sugar molecule ― whether in cocoa bean or pan or anywhere else ― turns brown when heated is to do with the presence of carbon. (A) Further roasting will turn some of the sugar into pure carbon (double bonds all round), which creates a burnt flavor and a dark­brown color. Complete roasting results in charcoal: all of the sugar has become carbon, which is black. (B) On the whole, it is the carbon­rich molecules that are larger, so these get left behind, and within these there is a structure called a carbon­carbon double bond. This chemical structure absorbs light. In small amounts it gives the caramelizing sugar a yellow­brown color. (C) Sugars are carbohydrates, which is to say that they are made of carbon (“carbo­”), hydrogen (“hydr­”), and oxygen (“­ate”) atoms. When heated, these long molecules disintegrate into smaller units, some of which are so small that they evaporate (which accounts for the lovely smell). [3점]",

        "question": "36 In the 1980s and ’90s, some conservationists predicted that orangutans would go extinct in the wild within 20 or 30 years. Fortunately that didn’t happen. Many thousands more orangutans are now known to exist than were recognized at the turn of the millennium.                                                  (A) In fact, the overall population of orangutans has fallen by at least 80 percent in the past 75 years. It’s indicative of the difficulty of orangutan research that scientist Erik Meijaard is willing to say only that between 40,000 and 100,000 live on Borneo. Conservationists on Sumatra estimate that only 14,000 survive there.  (B) This doesn’t mean that all is well in the orangutans’ world. The higher figures come thanks to improved survey methods and the discovery of previously unknown populations, not because the actual numbers have increased.   (C) Much of this loss has been driven by habitat destruction from logging and the rapid spread of vast plantations of oil palm, the fruit of which is sold to make oil used in cooking and in many food products.

They locked a rat in a tiny cage, placed the cage within a much larger cell and allowed another rat to roam freely through that cell. The caged rat gave out distress signals, which caused the free rat also to exhibit signs of anxiety and stress. In most cases, the free rat proceeded to help her trapped companion, and after several attempts usually succeeded in opening the cage and liberating the prisoner. The researchers then repeated the experiment, this time placing chocolate in the cell. The free rat now had to choose between either liberating the prisoner, or enjoying the chocolate all by herself. Many rats preferred to first free their companion and share the chocolate (though a few behaved more selfishly, proving perhaps that some rats are meaner than others). In a series of experiments, when the free rats witnessed their fellow in a state of (A) in a cage, they tended to rescue their companion, even (B) eating chocolate.
