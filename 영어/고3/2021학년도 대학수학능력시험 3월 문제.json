        "paragraph": "While user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to generate them, their existence inherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo. The fact is, successfully changing long­term user habits is exceptionally rare. Altering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act but also necessitates getting them to repeat behaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives. Companies that succeed in building a habit­forming business are often associated with game­changing, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not. For one, new behaviors have a short half­life, as our minds tend to return to our old ways of thinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to their first learned behaviors over time. To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO ─“last in, first out.”* boon: 요긴한 것 ** regress: 되돌아가다",

If the sale prices are easy to understand using percentages (for example, “-50%”) or with the new prices already calculated (for example, “now only $20”), shoppers will react in an automatic and positive fashion. However, if it is necessary for them to do complex mental calculations (for example, if a $27.50 product is advertised at 12% off), they will switch to a more analytical style of thinking. This results in more attention spent on the calculation, and subsequently on the merits of the product. No longer feeling spontaneous, shoppers will start questioning whether it is actually a good deal or not, whether they really need another pair of shoes, etc. The more cognitive effort is demanded from shoppers, the more of a negative and suspicious reaction will be evoked, and the chances of making a sale diminish.",

Self­perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character’s personality with the actor’s personality.

It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John’s College has a massive neo­Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled.* decorous: 품위 있는 ** surplice: 흰 가운 *** divest: 벗기다",

Shelton attended Bernarr Macfadden’s College of Physcultopathy in Chicago and interned at Crane’s Sanatorium in Elmhurst, Illinois. In 1921, he graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton’s work served as an early influence for the raw food movement. A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti­draft statement in public during the height of World War I. By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from Parkinson’s disease.

        "question": "36 A classic positive­sum game in economic life is the trading of surpluses. (A) One infrastructure that allows efficient exchange is transportation, which makes it possible for producers to trade their surpluses even when they are separated by distance. Another is money, interest, and middlemen, which allow producers to exchange many kinds of surpluses with many other producers at many points in time.(B) If a farmer has more grain than he can eat, and a herder has more milk than he can drink, both of them come out ahead if they trade some wheat for some milk. As they say, everybody wins. Of course, an exchange at a single moment in time only pays when there is a division of labor. (C) There would be no point in one farmer giving a bushel of wheat to another farmer and receiving a bushel of wheat in return. A fundamental insight of modern economics is that the key to the creation of wealth is a division of labor, in which specialists learn to produce a commodity with increasing cost­effectiveness and have the means to exchange their specialized products efficiently.

Consider an athlete who runs the 100 m wearing training shoes. She is unlikely to achieve as good a time wearing these shoes as she would if she wore specifically designed spiked running shoes.(A) Is she there because she really wants to be, or is she there just because her brother is also a runner and so her parents bring her along as well?",

Let us also consider other surrounding circumstances, such as what is motivating the athlete to run.(C) During athletic competitions wind speed is always measured as it is recognised as having an impact, either positively or negatively, on performance times. If our runner was running into a headwind, her speed would be reduced, as some of her force would be needed to overcome the additional obstacle of the wind.",

As with links, the ease and ready availability of searching make it much simpler to jump between digital documents than it ever was to jump between printed ones. Our attachment to any one text becomes more tenuous, more transitory. Searches also lead to the fragmentation of online works.
