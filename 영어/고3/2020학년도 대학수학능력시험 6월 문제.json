The reviewer was harsh, calling it “an awful performance.” That raised in Sharon’s mind the question of whether it was worthwhile to go, but in the end, she reluctantly decided to attend the concert. The hall located in the old town was ancient and run-down. Looking around, Sharon again wondered what kind of show she could expect. But as soon as the tango started, everything changed. The piano, guitar, flute, and violin magically flew out in harmony. The audience cheered. “Oh my goodness! What fantastic music!” Sharon shouted. The rhythm and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her body and soul. The concert was far beyond her expectations.",

Companions may likewise merely prevent discussing an issue by swiftly switching over topics when the subject turns up or by being incredibly vague. Such indirect ways of expressing temper are not useful since they don’t provide the individual that is the target of the behaviors, an idea of exactly how to react.

For example, retailers often boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or installation services. Think of a home goods retailer selling an unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its customer’s mission incomplete. When that retailer also sells assembly and delivery, it takes another step in the journey to the customer’s true mission of cooking in his backyard. Another example is the business-to-business service contracts that are layered on top of software sales. Maintenance, installation, training, delivery, anything at all that turns do-it-yourself into a do-it-for-me solution originally resulted from exploring the edge of where core products intersect with customer journeys.* ancillary: 보조의, 부차적인 ** intersect: 교차하다",

When a definition emphasizes rules, competition, and high performance, many people will be excluded from participation or avoid other physical activities that are defined as “second class.” For example, when a 12-year-old is cut from an exclusive club soccer team, she may not want to play in the local league because she sees it as “recreational activity” rather than a real sport. This can create a situation in which most people are physically inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans ― a situation that negatively impacts health and increases health-care costs in a society or community. When sport is defined to include a wide range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and integrated into local expressions of social life, physical activity rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely.",

They found that the respondents’ suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast. People presented with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the problem, such as eliminating poverty and improving education. On the other hand, people presented with the beast metaphor focused on remediations: increasing the size of the police force and prisons.",

In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental threat. In the absence of threat, natural selection tends to resist change. It is un-biological to “explain” behavioural change as resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of domain-specific brain modules. Evolutionary psychologists surely know why brains evolved: as Cosmides and Tooby point out, brains are found only in animals that move. Brains are behavioural organs, and behavioural adaptation, being immediate and non-random, is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation. So, in animals with brains, behavioural change is the usual first response to environmental threat. If the change is successful, genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more gradually.

After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge University, he became interested in human behavior. He believed human behavior to be based on three abilities ―intellect, emotion, and will. Being a hardworking scholar, he held academic positions in several universities in England. He also wrote many books on psychology including the well-known Introduction to Social Psychology. In 1920, he published The Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human behavior. However, The Group Mind was poorly received when published. Somewhat disappointed, he moved to the United States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University. Seven years later, he moved to Duke University, where he developed a psychology department and continued various research. Today many people read his books, and psychologists celebrate his intellectual achievements.",

As a result, researchers gradually began to believe that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness or stiffness of the surface on which they are running. This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain. As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types. Contrary to popular belief, running on concrete is not more damaging to the legs than running on soft sand. [3점]* compliant: 말랑말랑한 ** terrain: 지형",

        "question": "37 The fruit ripening process brings about the softening of cell walls, sweetening and the production of chemicals that give colour and flavour. The process is induced by the production of a plant hormone called ethylene. (A) If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with ethylene production or with the processes that respond to ethylene, fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe and full of flavour but would still be in good condition when it arrived at the supermarket shelf. (B) In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene before sale to the consumer to induce ripening. However, fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit picked ripe from the plant. Biotechnologists therefore saw an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening process in fruit.(C) The problem for growers and retailers is that ripening is followed sometimes quite rapidly by deterioration and decay and the product becomes worthless. Tomatoes and other fruits are, therefore, usually picked and transported when they are unripe. [3점]* deterioration: (품질의) 저하",

        "paragraph": "Some environments are more likely to lead to fossilization and subsequent discovery than others. Thus, we cannot assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or place means that more individuals were present at that time, or in that place. It may just be that the circumstances at one period of time, or at one location, were more favourable for fossilization than they were at other times, or in other places. Likewise, the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a particular time or place does not have the same implication as its presence. As the saying goes, ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. Similar logic suggests that taxa are likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil record, and they are likely to have survived beyond the time of their most recent appearance in the fossil record. Thus, the first appearance datum, and the last appearance datum of taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon.* subsequent: 다음의 ** hominin fossil: 인류 화석*** taxa: taxon(분류군)의 복수형󰀻Since fossilization and fossil discovery are affected by (A) conditions, the fossil evidence of a taxon cannot definitely (B) its population size or the times of its appearance and extinction.(A)(B)(A)(B)",
