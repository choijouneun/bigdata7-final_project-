His heart started pounding heavily; he was too scared to make a move. Sweat poured from his forehead.

The problem is that we are continually judging people, wishing they were something that they are not. We want to change them. We want them to think and act a certain way, most often the way we think and act. And because this is not possible, because everyone is different, we are continually frustrated and upset. Instead, see other people as phenomena, as neutral as comets or plants. They simply exist. They come in all varieties, making life rich and interesting. Work with what they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles. It is all part of the human comedy. Yes, people are irrational, but so are you. Make your acceptance of human nature as radical as possible. This will calm you down and help you observe people more dispassionately, understanding them on a deeper level.",

        "paragraph": "Many writers make the common mistake of being too vague when picturing a reader. When it comes to identifying a target audience, everyone is no one. You may worry about excluding other people if you write specifically for one individual. Relax― that doesn’t necessarily happen. A well-defined audience simplifies decisions about explanations and word choice. Your style may become more distinctive, in a way that attracts people beyond the target reader. For example, Andy Weir wrote The Martian for science fiction readers who want their stories firmly grounded in scientific fact, and perhaps rocket scientists who enjoy science fiction. I belong to neither audience, yet I enjoyed the book. Weir was so successful at pleasing his target audience that they shared it widely and enthusiastically. Because Weir didn’t try to cater to everyone, he wrote something that delighted his core audience. Eventually, his work traveled far beyond that sphere. It may be counterintuitive, but if you want to broaden your impact, tighten your focus on the reader.",

Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff ― the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet ― but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart. Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.

Art is difficult to define but is an ability to make something of more than ordinary significance. Science is a branch of knowledge which is systematic, testable, and objective ―science is what we know. When architecture and engineering get artificially separated, the outcomes may not be as they should be. For example, a developer investing in a new building might appoint an architect to develop a scheme proposal to meet the needs of the client. If that is done without the involvement of properly qualified engineers then, later, when the project gets underway, there will inevitably be practical problems. In the worst building projects architects specify structural forms that may simply be unbuildable or unnecessarily expensive to build. It follows that in the best building projects architects and engineers work together right from the start. Good structural design can provide a huge amount of savings in the cost of construction.",

He entered the University of Moscow in 1833, but before a year had passed he transferred to the University of St. Petersburg because of a family move. Later, he traveled to Germany, where he enrolled at the University of Berlin and studied philosophy for three years. Upon returning to St. Petersburg and failing to find an academic position, he began work as a public official there, but his interests turned more and more toward literature. After retiring from the service, he went to France. By the mid-1850s, he was spending as much time in Europe as in Russia. In August of 1860 in England, he conceived the idea for his Fathers and Sons; he finished the novel in July of 1861 in Russia. The book received a hostile reaction in Russia, but gained prominence in the Western world. He received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford in 1879.",

Though farmers could produce more food, they were also more likely to starve, because, unlike foragers, they relied on a small number of crops, and if those crops failed, they were in serious trouble. The bones of early farmers show evidence of vitamin deficiencies, probably caused by regular periods of starvation between harvests. They also show signs of stress, associated, perhaps, with the intensive labor required for plowing, harvesting crops, felling trees, maintaining buildings and fences, and grinding grains. Villages also produced refuse, which attracted vermin, and their populations were large enough to spread diseases that could not have survived in smaller, more nomadic foraging communities. All this evidence of suggests that the first farmers were pushed into the complex and increasingly interconnected farming lifeway rather than pulled by its advantages.* forager: 수렵채집인 ** refuse: 쓰레기 *** vermin: 해충",

Because “sea” primed the context, the heightened predictability caused the concept of “boat” to enter people’s minds more easily, and that ease of processing produced a pleasant feeling that became misattributed to the word “boat.” Marketers can take advantage of conceptual fluency and enhance the effectiveness of their advertisements by strategically . For example, an experiment showed that consumers found a ketchup ad more favorable when the ad was presented after an ad for mayonnaise. The mayonnaise ad primed consumers’ schema for condiments, and when the ad for ketchup was presented afterward, the idea of ketchup came to their minds more easily.

Further studies involving pythons (eating ground cooked steak versus intact raw steak) confirmed these findings. When we eat chewier, less processed foods, it takes us more energy to digest them, so the number of calories our body receives is less.

In general, people accept and deal with the set consequences of their actions prescribed by their surroundings.(A) He would of course bet in favor of himself. In doing so, he will receive both a positive incentive to complete the task (his desire to collect the reward for winning the bet) and a negative disincentive to quit the task (his desire to avoid having to pay out if he loses).(B) A bet is a typical example of this. A person striving to reach a difficult goal or complete a task ― building a rocking chair or losing weight, for instance ― will be wise to supplement his motivation to do so by making a bet on it with a friend.(C) It is, however, possible for a person to personally manipulate and create consequences for his actions. This will inevitably have an effect on his future motivation and behavior. Most often this is achieved through the imposition of monetary consequences. [3점]* monetary: 금전적인",
