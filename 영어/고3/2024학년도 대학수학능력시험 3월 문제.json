As such, learners need to be given the freedom and autonomy to assume responsibility for their own choices and to be proactive in making decisions that contribute to their educational experiences. Rather than perform the role of the “sage on the stage,” in working with adult learners, the instructor’s role should be the “guide on the side” — a facilitator of learning, and a coach or mentor who works alongside their learners to promote achievement and academic success. The facilitator role extends beyond course delivery, and includes the broader pedagogical tasks that will support learners on their growth such as helping them effectively manage their time; fostering engagement; assigning meaningful and relevant learning activities; and so on.* autonomy: 자율성, 자주성 ** sage: 현자 *** pedagogical: 교육적인",

It is true of your social perceptions as well ―your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine’s taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn’t because the subjects consciously believed that the higher­priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn’t true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That’s related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don’t just taste the wine; you taste its price.",

The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well­being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true ― the second language is associated with post­immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language.* rattle: 당황하게[겁먹게] 하다 ** connotation: 함축(된 의미)*** persecution: 박해",

We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups.

In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists’ palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese. Rather than alter the name to fit reality, the Japanese government announced in 1973 that : henceforth, go lights would be a color that better corresponded to the dominant meaning of ao.

        "question": "36 Different creative pursuits require varying degrees of unconscious flexible thinking, in combination with varying degrees of the conscious ability to adjust it and shape it through analytical thinking. In music, for example, at one end of the creative spectrum are improvisational artists, such as jazz musicians.(A) On the other end of the spectrum are those who compose complex forms, such as a symphony or concerto, that require not just imagination but also careful planning and exacting editing. We know, for example, through his letters and the reports of others, that even Mozart’s creations did not appear spontaneously, wholly formed in his consciousness, as the myths about him portray.(B) They have to be particularly talented at lowering their inhibitions and letting in their unconsciously generated ideas. And although the process of learning the fundamentals of jazz would require a high degree of analytical thought, that thinking style is not as big a factor during the performance.(C) Instead, he spent long, hard hours analyzing and reworking the ideas that arose in his unconscious, much as a scientist does when producing a theory from a germ of insight. In Mozart’s own words: “I immerse myself in music... I think about it all day long ― I like experimenting ― studying ― reflecting...” [3점]* improvisational: 즉흥적인 ** immerse: ~에 몰두하다",

        "question": "37 Today, historic ideas about integrating nature and urban/suburban space find expression in various interpretations of sustainable urban planning. (A) But Landscape Urbanists find that these designs do not prioritize the natural environment and often involve diverting streams and disrupting natural wetlands. Still others, such as those advocating for “just sustainabilities” or “complete streets,” find that both approaches are overly idealistic and neither pays enough attention to the realities of social dynamics and systemic inequality.(B) However, critics claim that Landscape Urbanists prioritize aesthetic and ecological concerns over human needs. In contrast, New Urbanism is an approach that was popularized in the 1980s and promotes walkable streets, compact design, and mixed­use developments.(C) However, the role of social justice in these approaches remains highly controversial. For example, Landscape Urbanism is a relatively recent planning approach that advocates for native habitat designs that include diverse species and landscapes that require very low resource use.* compact: 고밀도, 촘촘한** divert: 우회시키다, 방향을 바꾸게 하다",

        "paragraph": "“Brain plasticity” is a term we use in neuroscience. Whether intentionally or not, “plasticity” suggests that the key idea is to mold something once and keep it that way forever: to shape the plastic toy and never change it again. But that’s not what the brain does. It carries on remolding itself throughout your life. Think of a developing city, and note the way it grows, improves, and responds to the world around it. Observe where the city builds its truck stops, how it crafts its immigration policies, and how it modifies its education and legal systems. A city is always changing. A city is not designed by urban planners and then immobilized like a plastic object. It continually develops. Just like cities, brains never reach an end point. We spend our lives blossoming toward something, even as the target moves. Consider the feeling of encountering a diary that you wrote many years ago. It represents the thinking, opinions, and viewpoint of someone who was a bit different from who you are now, and that previous person can sometimes border on the unrecognizable. Despite having the same name and the same early history, in the years between inscription and interpretation the narrator has altered. The word “plastic” can be stretched to fit this notion of ongoing change.* mold: 성형(成形)하다 ** inscription: 새겨진 글, 명문(銘文)While some understand “brain plasticity” to mean (A) upon molding, the brain is actually capable of (B).(A) (B)",
