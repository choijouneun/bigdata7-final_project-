In this case you could simply say, “Tom. It’s nice to meet you, Tom.” Saying this short phrase repeats the word twice aloud. Saying something aloud creates a more powerful memory than only thinking it. The choice to say the word, mouthing it and hearing yourself say it, makes up a series of small events that increase memorization more than if you simply repeat the word in your mind. Continuing to repeat the name throughout conversation will further cement it in your memory. Say it whenever you have the opportunity to do so naturally.",

Globally, beef cattle and milk cattle have the most significant impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions(GHGEs), and are responsible for 41% of the world’s CO2 emissions and 20% of the total global GHGEs. The atmospheric increases in GHGEs caused by the transport, land clearance, methane emissions, and grain cultivation associated with the livestock industry are the main drivers behind increases in global temperatures. In contrast to conventional livestock, insects as “minilivestock” are low-GHGE emitters, use minimal land, can be fed on food waste rather than cultivated grain, and can be farmed anywhere thus potentially also avoiding GHGEs caused by long distance transportation. If we increased insect consumption and decreased meat consumption worldwide, the global warming potential of the food system would be significantly reduced.",

We approximate using a ‘round number’ as a place mark. It is easier and more convenient. When we say, for example, that there were a hundred people at the market, we don’t mean that there were exactly one hundred people there. And when we say that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, we don’t mean exactly 13,700,000,000; we mean give or take a few hundred million years. Big numbers are understood approximately, small ones precisely, and these two systems interact uneasily. It is clear nonsense to say that next year the universe will be ‘13.7 billion and one’ years old. It will remain 13.7 billion years old for the rest of our lives.",

        "question": "36 Most habits are probably good when they are first formed. That is, for many of the habits that you do not create intentionally, there must have been some value to performing that particular behavior. (A) Overeating is one such habit. You may know conceptually that eating too much is a problem. But when you actually overeat, there are few really negative consequences in the moment. (B) That value is what causes you to repeat the behavior often enough to create the habit. Some habits become bad, because a behavior that has rewarding elements to it at one time also has negative consequences that may not have been obvious when the habit began. (C) So you do it again and again. Eventually, though, you’ll start to gain weight. By the time you really notice this, your habit of eating too much is deeply rooted. [3점]",

These facts aren’t objective, of course. If you happen to be placed in a classroom of future professional statisticians, inevitably you feel relatively bad at math.

With my suitcase packed and some peanut butter sandwiches in a bag, I started for the front door of our bungalow in Wantagh. My mom asked where I was going. “I’m leaving home,” I said. “Billy, what’s that you’re carrying?” she asked. “Some clothes and food,” I replied. “If (a) you want to run away, that’s all right,” she said. “But you came into this home without anything and you can leave the same way.” I threw my suitcase and sandwiches on the floor angrily and started for the door again.

Let me in!” The door inched open and Mom’s smiling face appeared. “Did you change (c) your mind about running away?” she asked. “What’s for supper?” I answered. (C) “Wait a minute,” Mom said. “You didn’t have any clothes on when you arrived, and I want them back.” This annoyed me. I took my clothes off — shoes, socks, underwear and all — and shouted, “Can (d) I go now?” “Yes,” my mom answered, “but once you close that door, don’t expect to come back.” I was so angry I slammed the door and stepped out on the front porch. Suddenly I realized that I was outside, completely naked. Then I noticed that down the street, a neighbor friend was walking toward our house.
