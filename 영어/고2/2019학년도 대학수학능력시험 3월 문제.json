You don’t eat many of these foods at home, and you want to try them all. But trying them all might mean eating more than your usual meal size. The availability of different types of food is one factor in gaining weight. Scientists have seen this behavior in studies with rats: Rats that normally maintain a steady body weight when eating one type of food eat huge amounts and become obese when they are presented with a variety of high­calorie foods, such as chocolate bars, crackers, and potato chips. The same is true of humans. We eat much more when a variety of good­tasting foods are available than when only one or two types of food are available.",

Less well known at the time was the fact that Freud had found out, almost by accident, how helpful his pet dog Jofi was to his patients. He had only become a dog­lover in later life when Jofi was given to him by his daughter Anna. The dog sat in on the doctor’s therapy sessions and Freud discovered that his patients felt much more comfortable talking about their problems if the dog was there. Some of them even preferred to talk to Jofi, rather than the doctor! Freud noted that if the dog sat near the patient, the patient found it easier to relax, but if Jofi sat on the other side of the room, the patient seemed more tense and distressed. He was surprised to realize that Jofi seemed to sense this too. The dog’s presence was an especially calming influence on child and teenage patients.",

Y. had to go to work at age twelve to help support his brothers and sisters. Working in a print shop, he became interested in art, and he began to paint landscapes in a fresh new style. Traveling by train across northern Ontario, A. Y. and several other artists painted everything they saw. The “Group of Seven,” as they called themselves, put the results of the tour together to create an art show in Toronto in 1920. That was the show where their paintings were severely criticized as “art gone mad.” But he kept painting, traveling, and exhibiting, and by the time he died in 1974 at the age of eighty­two, A. Y. Jackson was acknowledged as a painting genius and a pioneer of modern landscape art.",

Her point of view was different from mine, and resulted in a different diagram of the classroom.",

Then the “good father” comes along and feels he should “share” the experience and help his son “develop.” (A) But most of the members of the human race have lost the capacity to be painters, poets, or musicians, and are not left the option of seeing and hearing directly even if they can afford to; they must get it secondhand.(B) He says: “That’s a jay, and this is a sparrow.” The moment the little boy is concerned with which is a jay and which is a sparrow, he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing. He has to see and hear them the way the father wants him to.(C) Father has good reasons on his side, since few people can go through life listening to the birds sing, and the sooner the boy starts his “education” the better. Maybe he will be an ornithologist when he grows up. A few people, however, can still see and hear in the old way. [3점]* ornithologist: 조류학자",

When this happens, we as parents can help bring the left hemisphere into the picture so that the child can begin to understand what’s happening. One of the best ways to promote this type of integration is to help retell the story of the frightening or painful experience. Bella, for instance, was nine years old when the toilet overflowed when she flushed, and the experience of watching the water rise and pour onto the floor left her unwilling to flush the toilet afterward. When Bella’s father, Doug, learned about the “name it to tame it” technique, he sat down with his daughter and retold the story of the time the toilet overflowed. He allowed her to tell as much of the story as she could and helped to fill in the details. After retelling the story several times, Bella’s fears lessened and eventually went away.We may enable a child to (A) their painful, frightening experience by having them (B) as much of the painful story as possible.
