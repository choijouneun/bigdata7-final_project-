        "paragraph": "Anxiety has been around for thousands of years. According to evolutionary psychologists, it is adaptive to the extent that it helped our ancestors avoid situations in which the margin of error between life and death was slim. Anxiety warned people when their lives were in danger: not only from wild tigers, cave bears, hungry hyenas, and other animals stalking the landscape, but also from hostile, competing tribes. Being on alert helped ancient people fight predators, flee from enemies, or “freeze,” blending in, as if camouflaged, so they wouldn’t be noticed. It mobilized them to react to real threats to their survival. It pushed them into keeping their children out of harm’s way. Anxiety thus persisted through evolution in a majority of the population because it was (and can be) an advantageous, life­saving trait.                        * camouflaged: 위장한",

        "paragraph": "The first humans who figured out how to write things down around 5,000 years ago were in essence trying to increase the capacity of their hippocampus, part of the brain’s memory system. They effectively extended the natural limits of human memory by preserving some of their memories on clay tablets and cave walls, and later, papyrus and parchment. Later, we developed other mechanisms ―such as calendars, filing cabinets, computers, and smartphones ― to help us organize and store the information we’ve written down. When our computer or smartphone starts to run slowly, we might buy a larger memory card. That memory is both a metaphor and a physical reality. We are off­loading a great deal of the processing that our neurons would normally do to an external device that then becomes an extension of our own brains, a neural enhancer.* parchment: 양피지",

Doctors predicted that he would not be able to walk again. Stevens’ father, however, was not a believer in bed rest. He piled sketchpads and model kits next to the boy’s bed and encouraged him to build miniature airplanes and boats. Stevens enrolled at Cornell University to study architecture but left Cornell without a diploma. Later, he returned to Milwaukee to work as an inventory manager. Bored and restless, he persuaded the head of his company to let him redesign some of the product labels. This opportunity was the first step towards Stevens’ career as an industrial designer. He opened his first office in 1935 and later created his own Auto Museum, which displayed both vehicles of his own design and those that he admired.* polio: 소아마비",

Access to TV sets and telephones is not the same as access to computers and networks.(A) However, multi­functionality also results in extremely different applications, both advanced, with many opportunities to learn and build a career, and simple, mainly focused on entertainment. Other characteristics decreasing equality of access are the complexity, expensiveness and lack of user­friendliness of many contemporary new media.(B) All media have characteristics supporting and discouraging access. Computers and their networks support access because they are multi­purpose or multi­functional technologies enabling all kinds of information, communication, transaction, work, education and entertainment.(C) So, there are useful applications for everybody. Moreover, the extension of networks produces network effects: the more people gain access, the more valuable a connection becomes. [3점]",

        "question": "37 In a crowded world, an unmanaged commons cannot possibly work. That is an important qualification. If the world is not crowded, a commons may in fact be the best method of distribution. (A) A plainsman could kill an American bison, cut out only the tongue for his dinner, and discard the rest of the animal. He was not being wasteful in any important sense. Nor did it much matter how a lonely American frontiersman disposed of his waste. (B) For example, when the pioneers spread out across the United States, the most efficient way was to treat all the game in the wild as an unmanaged commons because for a long time humans couldn’t do any real damage. (C) Today, with only a few thousand bison left, we would be outraged by such careless behavior. As the population in the United States became denser, the land’s natural chemical and biological recycling processes were overloaded. Careful management of these resources became necessary, from bison to oil and water.* commons: 공동 자원, 공유지 ** game: 야생의 사냥감",

        "paragraph": "Research by Paul Slovic of Decision Research and the University of Oregon shows that people who are otherwise caring and would go out of their way to help another individual become indifferent to the suffering of the masses. In one experiment, people were given $5 to donate to lessen hunger overseas. The first choice was to give the money to a particular child, Rokia, a seven­year­old in Mali. The second choice was to help twenty­one million hungry Africans. The third choice was to help Rokia, but as just one of many victims of hunger. Can you guess which choice was most popular  Slovic reported that donations to the individual, Rokia, were far greater than donations to the second choice, the statistical portrayal of the hunger crisis. That’s not particularly surprising. But what is surprising, and some would say discouraging, is that adding the statistical realities of the larger hunger problem to Rokia’s story significantly reduced the contributions to Rokia. 󰀻An experiment shows that while people are more willing to help (A) in need, they become indifferent when given the (B) perspective of hunger.
