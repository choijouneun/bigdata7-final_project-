        "paragraph": "The arts and aesthetics offer emotional connection to the full range of human experience. “The arts can be more than just sugar on the tongue,” Anjan Chatterjee, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says. “In art, when there’s something challenging, which can also be uncomfortable, this discomfort, if we’re willing to engage with it, offers the possibility of some change, some transformation. That can also be a powerful aesthetic experience.” The arts, in this way, become vehicles to contend with ideas and concepts that are difficult and uncomfortable otherwise. When Picasso painted his masterpiece Guernica in 1937, he captured the heartbreaking and cruel nature of war, and offered the world a way to consider the universal suffering caused by the Spanish Civil War. When Lorraine Hansberry wrote her play A Raisin in the Sun, she gave us a powerful story of people struggling with racism, discrimination, and the pursuit of the American dream while also offering a touching portrait of family life.",

        "paragraph": "Many historians have pointed to the significance of accurate time measurement to Western economic progress. The French historian Jacques Le Goff called the birth of the public mechanical clock a turning point in Western society. Until the late Middle Ages, people had sun or water clocks, which did not play any meaningful role in business activities. Market openings and activities started with the sunrise and typically ended at noon when the sun was at its peak. But when the first public mechanical clocks were introduced and spread across European cities, market times were set by the stroke of the hour. Public clocks thus greatly contributed to public life and work by providing a new concept of time that was easy for everyone to understand. This, in turn, helped facilitate trade and commerce. Interactions and transactions between consumers, retailers, and wholesalers became less irregular. Important town meetings began to follow the pace of the clock, allowing people to better plan their time and allocate resources in a more efficient manner.",

It was an excellent device that would make it easy for shoppers to buy as much as they wanted without getting tired or seeking others’ help. But Goldman discovered that in spite of his repeated advertisements and explanations, he could not persuade his shoppers to use the wheeled carts. Men were reluctant because they thought they would appear weak if they pushed such carts instead of carrying their shopping. Women wouldn’t touch them because the carts reminded them of baby carriages. It was only a few elderly shoppers who used them. That made the carts even less attractive to the majority of the shoppers. Then Goldman hit upon an idea. He hired several models, men and women, of different ages and asked them to wheel the carts in the store and shop. A young woman employee standing near the entrance told the regular shoppers, ‘Look, everyone is using the carts. Why don’t you ’ That was the turning point. A few shills disguised as regular shoppers easily accomplished what logic, explanations, and advertisements failed to do. Within a few weeks shoppers readily accepted those carts.* shill: 바람잡이",

Even if deception is sometimes allowed when it serves worthy goals, should it be allowed for vulnerable users  Just as children on the autism spectrum with robot companions might be easily fooled into thinking of robots as friends, older adults with cognitive deficits might be. According to Alexis Elder, a professor at UMD, robots are false friends, inferior to true friendship. Reasoning along similar lines, John Sullins, a professor at Sonoma State University, holds that robots should “remain iconic or cartoonish so that they are easily distinguished as synthetic even by unsophisticated users.” At least then no one is fooled. Making robots clearly fake also avoids the so-called “uncanny valley,” where robots are perceived as scary because they so closely resemble us, but not quite.

In the early 1900s, Virginia banks owned by white bankers were unwilling to do business with African American organizations or individuals. The racial discrimination by white bankers drove her to study banking and financial laws. She established a newspaper to promote closer communication between the charitable organization she belonged to and the public. Soon after, she founded the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, which survived the Great Depression and merged with two other banks. It thrived as the oldest continually African American-operated bank until 2009. Walker achieved successes with the vision to make improvements in the way of life for African Americans.",

        "question": "36 The size of a species is not accidental. It’s a fine-tuned interaction between a species and the world it inhabits. Over large periods of time, size fluctuations have often signalled significant changes in the environment.(A) But we are beginning to see changes in this trend. Scientists have discovered that many animals are shrinking. Around the world, species in every category have been found to be getting smaller, and one major cause appears to be the heat.(B) Generally speaking, over the last five hundred million years, the trend has been towards animals getting larger. It’s particularly notable in marine animals, whose average body size has increased 150-fold in this time.(C) Animals living in the Italian Alps, for example, have seen temperatures rise by three to four degrees Celsius since the 1980s. To avoid overheating, chamois goats now spend more of their days resting rather than searching for food, and as a result, in just a few decades, the new generations of chamois are 25 percent smaller.",

        "question": "37 For a long time, random sampling was a good shortcut. It made analysis of large data problems possible in the pre-digital era.(A) There is no need to focus at the beginning, since collecting all the information makes it possible to do that afterwards. Because rays from the entire light field are included, it is closer to all the data. As a result, the information is more “reuseable” than ordinary pictures, where the photographer has to decide what to focus on before she presses the shutter.(B) But much as converting a digital image or song into a smaller file results in loss of data, information is lost when sampling. Having the full (or close to the full) dataset provides a lot more freedom to explore, to look at the data from different angles or to look closer at certain aspects of it.(C) A fitting example may be the light-field camera, which captures not just a single plane of light, as with conventional cameras, but rays from the entire light field, some 11 million of them. The photographers can decide later which element of an image to focus on in the digital file. [3점]",

One way to demonstrate this is to give people the opportunity to act positively or negatively toward contributors.

People who contributed more to the group fund were given responsibility for more money than people who contributed less. Similar results have been found by other researchers. People who contribute toward their groups are also chosen more often as interaction partners, preferred as leaders, rated as more desirable partners for long-term relationships, and are perceived to be trustworthy and have high social status. Uncooperative people tend to receive verbal criticism or even more severe punishment.뾞Studies suggest that individuals who act with (A) toward their communities are more likely to be viewed as deserving of (B)  by members of that community than those who don’t.
