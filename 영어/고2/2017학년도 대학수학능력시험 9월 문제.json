Regarding climate effects in general, developing countries are likely to experience more negative effects of global warming. Not only do many developing countries have naturally warmer climates than those in the developed world, they also rely more heavily on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and tourism. As temperatures rise further, regions such as Africa will face declining crop yields and will struggle to produce sufficient food for domestic consumption, while their major exports will likely fall in volume. This effect will be made worse for these regions if developed countries are able to make up for the fall in agricultural output with new sources, potentially from their own domestic economies as their land becomes more suitable for growing crops.",

        "question": "22 Nervousness about public speaking is one of the most common fears among people. It can serve as a real and significant barrier to effective communication and ultimately to academic and professional success. Debate is an ideal setting to develop coping strategies that allow people to manage their speech anxiety. Because debate both requires and allows for a lot of preparation, individuals develop confidence in their materials and passion for the ideas they support. Debate provides a focus on the content over style, so the attention is on the arguments, not on the person. Participants may forget to be nervous as they have so much else to think about. And repetition of experience helps them build confidence and learn to cope with their inevitable nervousness in such a way as to prevent it from interfering with their objectives.",

To want to spare children from having to go through unpleasant experiences is a noble aim, and it naturally stems from love and concern for the child.

Samuel Smiles, a nineteenth­century English author, wrote, “It is doubtful whether any heavier curse could be forced on man than the complete gratification of all his wishes without effort on his part, leaving nothing for his hopes, desires, or struggles.” For healthy development, the child needs to deal with some failure, struggle through some difficult periods, and experience some painful emotions.    * gratification: 만족(감), 희열",

At age nine, he played first violin in the orchestra of Bergen’s theater. His debut as a soloist came in 1819, and by 1828 he was made conductor of the Musical Lyceum. He is believed to have composed more than 70 works, but only about 10 remain today.      In 1850, caught up in a rising tide of Norwegian romantic nationalism, Bull co­founded the first theater in which actors performed in Norwegian rather than Danish.

Now the factory received the same amount of materials, but instead of producing a fixed number of shoes, the factory was expected to produce a fixed number of tons of shoes.

        "paragraph": "(A) Clever technicians create the illusion of control by installing fake temperature dials. This reduces energy bills ― and complaints. Such tricks are called “placebo buttons” and they are being pushed in all sorts of contexts.   (B) The button’s real purpose is to make us believe we have an influence on the traffic lights, and thus we’re better able to endure the wait for the signal to change with more patience.   (C) The same goes for “door­open” and “door­close” buttons in elevators: Many are not even connected to the electrical panel. Such tricks are also designed in offices: For some people it will always be too hot, for others, too cold.",

        "question": "Both taxi and bus drivers use a part of their brain called the hippocampus to navigate routes that can sometimes be very complicated. Who would you guess has the larger hippocampus: the taxi driver or bus driver?",
        "paragraph": "(A) In contrast, most bus drivers follow the same route every day and therefore do not stimulate their hippocampus as much. Over time, the taxi driver’s role triggers a growth of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus, resulting in its increased size.   (B) Brain changes like this are the basis for seeing improvement in mental performance. So if you put away your satellite navigation system and regularly use your memory instead, you may end up with a larger hippocampus and perhaps a better memory, too.   (C) The answer is the taxi driver. This is because taxi drivers need to take new routes quite often. To do this, they use their hippocampus intensively to memorize all kinds of routes and figure out the quickest way to reach their destinations. * hippocampus: (뇌의) 해마",

This difference in perception showed up in a physical challenge, too.

But when the gift card’s value was $0, people threw their beanbags past the card by an inch. As the brain evolved, people who saw distances to goals as shorter might have gone after what they wanted more often.
