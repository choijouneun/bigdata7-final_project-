Your reputation as a world‒class violinist precedes you and the students consider you the musician who has influenced them the most.

The most famous quote expressing this comes from Shakespeare: “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances, / And one man in his time plays many parts.” If the theater and actors were traditionally represented by the image of masks, writers such as Shakespeare are implying that all of us are constantly wearing masks. Some people are better actors than others. Evil types such as Iago in the play Othello are able to conceal their hostile intentions behind a friendly smile. Others are able to act with more confidence and bravado — they often become leaders. People with excellent acting skills can better navigate our complex social environments and get ahead.* bravado: 허세",

        "question": "36 The invention of the mechanical clock was influenced by monks who lived in monasteries that were the examples of order and routine.(A) Time was determined by watching the length of the weighted rope. The discovery of the pendulum in the seventeenth century led to the widespread use of clocks and enormous public clocks. Eventually, keeping time turned into serving time. (B) They had to keep accurate time so that monastery bells could be rung at regular intervals to announce the seven hours of the day reserved for prayer. Early clocks were nothing more than a weight tied to a rope wrapped around a revolving drum.(C) People started to follow the mechanical time of clocks rather than their natural body time. They ate at meal time, rather than when they were hungry, and went to bed when it was time, rather than when they were sleepy. Even periodicals and fashions became “yearly.” The world had become orderly. * monastery: 수도원 ** pendulum: 흔들리는 추",

(A) If it did, we can move on and make an objective and informed decision. If it didn’t, we can try the same strategy again or implement a new one until we are ready to make a rational judgment. (B) Then we can choose an appropriate de‒biasing strategy to combat it. After we have implemented a strategy, we should check in again to see if it worked in the way we had hoped.

        "paragraph": "Why do we help  One widely held view is that self‒interest underlies all human interactions, that our constant goal is to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Accountants call it cost‒benefit analysis. Philosophers call it utilitarianism. Social psychologists call it social exchange theory. If you are considering whether to donate blood, you may weigh the costs of doing so (time, discomfort, and anxiety) against the benefits (reduced guilt, social approval, and good feelings). If the rewards exceed the costs, you will help. Others believe that we help because we have been socialized to do so, through norms that prescribe how we ought to behave. Through socialization, we learn the reciprocity norm: the expectation that we should return help, not harm, to those who have helped us. In our relations with others of similar status, the reciprocity norm compels us to give (in favors, gifts, or social invitations) about as much as we receive. People help because helping gives them     (A)    , but also because they are socially learned to     (B)     what others have done for them.
