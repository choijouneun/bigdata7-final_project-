They may believe it’s none of their business: if employees want to do volunteer activity, they can make their own arrangements and do so on their own time. Corporations also may be concerned about allocating the resources needed to set up such programs, or perhaps they fear that facilitating employees’ engagement elsewhere may weaken their commitment to the organization or their jobs. Not to worry on that last point: research shows that participating in corporate volunteer activity heightens rather than weakens employees’ organizational commitment, in part because people feel a sense of self­worth when they do the good deeds that their organizations made it easier for them to do.",

In fact, he even played with the Berlin Municipal Orchestra for a while. Although music was important to Paul, he became an artist. In 1898, he began his art career by studying at the Munich Academy. After, from January 1921 to April 1931, he taught painting at the Bauhaus. Paul also kept a notebook of his artistic insights and ideas and published a number of books about art.

        "question": "38 Evolution did not give humans the ability to play soccer. True, it produced legs for kicking and elbows for fouling, but all that this enables us to do is perhaps practice penalty kicks alone.(A) Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by instinct — puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough­and­tumble play built into their genes.(B) But human teenagers have no such genes for soccer. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about soccer. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game. (C) To get into a game with the strangers we find in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before, we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing by the same rules.

(A) The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits and snails for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrow’s menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.(B) The typical peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she was lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs. (C) Especially in pre­modern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop― such as wheat, potatoes, or rice ― that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional materials humans need.

        "paragraph": "Some companies provide their employees with cafeteria incentive programs. The term cafeteria is used because choices are similar to those in a cafeteria, in which a diner proceeds down the line and chooses those foods that he or she would like and leaves the others. Cafeteria incentives take a variety of forms. In many cases, the company will put aside a pool of money that each individual can spend on these options, such as $3,000 annually. Then, if one person has a family with two small children and wants to use some of this money for a child­care program, the costs are automatically deducted from that employee’s pool of money. Another individual might purchase additional life insurance or medical coverage to meet his or her specific needs. At Lincoln Electric, for example, all payments for worker medical insurance come from the bonus pool. The employees decide what type of coverage they want and the cost is deducted from their bonus.         * deduct: 공제하다Cafeteria incentive programs provide employees with           (A)    choices, and employees’ selections are based on their     (B)    .
