Animals including humans cannot live without knowing what is useful to them and what is needed for their survival: where to find food, how to avoid predators, where to find mates, etc. However, the human species differs from other animals because we thirst for knowledge that reaches far beyond our personal needs. We look around us and we wonder. We wonder about our surroundings and about what we observe both near and far and we want to understand it all. Indeed, we fear the unknown. This sense of wonder and desire for understanding not only makes us human, but is also one of the foundation stones of civilization.",

Those different strategies together lead to poorer reading comprehension in contrast to reading the same texts on paper. Moreover, there is an additional feature of the screen: hypertext. Above all, a hypertext connection is not one that you have made yourself, and it will not necessarily have a place in your own unique conceptual framework. Therefore, it may not help you understand and digest what you’re reading at your own appropriate pace, and it may even distract you.* detection: 찾기, 탐색",
