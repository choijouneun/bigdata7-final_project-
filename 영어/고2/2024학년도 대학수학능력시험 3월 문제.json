Yes, the vehicle would have been able to move forward on its own, but it could not slow down, stop, or turn to avoid barriers. Obviously not ideal. But does that mean the entire concept of the self­driving car is not worth pursuing  No, it only means that at the time we did not yet have the tools we now possess to help enable vehicles to operate both autonomously and safely. This once­distant dream now seems within our reach. It is much the same story in medicine. Two decades ago, we were still taping bricks to accelerators. Today, we are approaching the point where we can begin to bring some appropriate technology to bear in ways that advance our understanding of patients as unique individuals. In fact, many patients are already wearing devices that monitor their conditions in real time, which allows doctors to talk to their patients in a specific, refined, and feedback­driven way that was not even possible a decade ago.* strap: 끈으로 묶다  ** autonomously: 자율적으로",

This phenomenon corresponds with a broader, international embrace of what is seemingly children’s culture among audiences of diverse ages.

When our curiosity leads to something novel, the resulting reward brings us a sense of pleasure. A number of investigators have modeled how curiosity influences musical composition. In the case of Beethoven, computer modeling focused on the thirty­two piano sonatas written after age thirteen revealed that the musical patterns found in all of Beethoven’s music decreased in later sonatas, while novel patterns, including patterns that were unique to a particular sonata, increased.

        "question": "36 Development of the human body from a single cell provides many examples of the structural richness that is possible when the repeated production of random variation is combined with nonrandom selection.(A) Those in the right place that make the right connections are stimulated, and those that don’t are eliminated. This process is much like sculpting. A natural consequence of the strategy is great variability from individual to individual at the cell and molecular levels, even though large­scale structures are quite similar.(B) The survivors serve to produce new cells that undergo further rounds of selection. Except in the immune system, cells and extensions of cells are not genetically selected during development, but rather, are positionally selected.(C) All phases of body development from embryo to adult exhibit random activities at the cellular level, and body formation depends on the new possibilities generated by these activities coupled with selection of those outcomes that satisfy previously built­in criteria. Always new structure is based on old structure, and at every stage selection favors some cells and eliminates others. [3점]* molecular: 분자의 ** embryo: 배아",

The home care workers, on the other hand, may perceive their work not as a set of separate tasks to be performed as efficiently as possible, but as a service to be provided to a client with whom they may have developed a relationship.(B) These systems specify tasks of home care workers and the time and budget available to perform these tasks. Electronic reporting systems require home care workers to report on their activities and the time spent, thus making the distribution of time and money visible and, in the perception of managers, controllable.(C) This includes having conversations with clients and enquiring about the person’s well­being. Restricted time and the requirement to report may be perceived as obstacles that make it impossible to deliver the service that is needed. If the management systems are too rigid, this may result in home care workers becoming overloaded and demotivated. [3점]",

As a result, data collected in large data repositories become “data tombs” — data archives that are hardly visited. Important decisions are often made based not on the information–rich data stored in data repositories but rather on a decision maker’s instinct, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to extract the valuable knowledge hidden in the vast amounts of data. Efforts have been made to develop expert system and knowledge­based technologies, which typically rely on users or domain experts to manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. However, this procedure is likely to cause biases and errors and is extremely costly and time consuming.
