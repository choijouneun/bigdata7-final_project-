No matter how many mock disasters are staged according to prior plans, the real disaster will never mirror any one of them. Disaster­preparation planning is more like training for a marathon than training for a high­jump competition or a sprinting event. Marathon runners do not practice by running the full course of twenty­six miles; rather, they get into shape by running shorter distances and building up their endurance with cross­training. If they have prepared successfully, then they are in optimal condition to run the marathon over its predetermined course and length, assuming a range of weather conditions, predicted or not. This is normal marathon preparation.* contingency: 비상사태  ** mock: 모의의*** cross­training: 여러 가지 운동을 조합하여 행하는 훈련법",

It is a romantic, not to say idyllic, notion, but deeply misleading because it supposes a static condition. Ecosystems are dynamic, and although some may endure, apparently unchanged, for periods that are long in comparison with the human lifespan, they must and do change eventually. Species come and go, climates change, plant and animal communities adapt to altered circumstances, and when examined in fine detail such adaptation and consequent change can be seen to be taking place constantly. The ‘balance of nature’ is a myth. Our planet is dynamic, and so are the arrangements by which its inhabitants live together.* idyllic: 목가적인",

Plato argued that the poet was possessed by divine inspiration, and Plotin wrote that art could only be beautiful if it descended from God. The artist’s job was not to imitate nature but rather to reveal the sacred and transcendent qualities of nature. Art could only be a pale imitation of the perfection of the world of ideas.

        "question": "Once we recognize the false­cause issue, we see it everywhere. For example, a recent long­term study of University of Toronto medical students concluded that medical school class presidents lived an average of 2.4 years less than other medical school graduates.(A) Perhaps this extra stress, and the corresponding lack of social and relaxation time ― rather than being class president per se ― contributes to lower life expectancy. If so, the real lesson of the study is that we should all relax a little and not let our work take over our lives.(B) Probably not. Just because being class president is correlated with shorter life expectancy does not mean that it causes shorter life expectancy. In fact, it seems likely that the sort of person who becomes medical school class president is, on average, extremely hard­working, serious, and ambitious.(C) At first glance, this seemed to imply that being a medical school class president is bad for you. Does this mean that you should avoid being medical school class president at all costs?",

        "question": "37 We commonly argue about the fairness of taxation ―whether this or that tax will fall more heavily on the rich or the poor.(A) Taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and casinos are called “sin taxes” because they seek to discourage activities considered harmful or undesirable. Such taxes express society’s disapproval of these activities by raising the cost of engaging in them. Proposals to tax sugary sodas (to combat obesity) or carbon emissions (to address climate change) likewise seek to change norms and shape behavior.(B) But the expressive dimension of taxation goes beyond debates about fairness, to the moral judgements societies make about which activities are worthy of honor and recognition, and which ones should be discouraged. Sometimes, these judgements are explicit. (C) Not all taxes have this aim. We do not tax income to express disapproval of paid employment or to discourage people from engaging in it. Nor is a general sales tax intended as a deterrent to buying things. These are simply ways of raising revenue.* deterrent: 억제책",

Our reflective brains know that the fruit salad is better for our health, but our reflexive brains desire that soft, fattening chocolate cake. If the reflective brain is busy figuring something else out — like trying to remember a seven­digit number — then impulse can easily win. On the other hand, if we’re not thinking too hard about something else (with only a minor distraction like memorizing two digits), then the reflective system can deny the emotional impulse of the reflexive side.* reflective: 숙고하는  ** reflexive: 반사적인According to the above experiment, the (A) intellective load on the brain leads the reflexive side of the brain to become (B).(A)(B)",
