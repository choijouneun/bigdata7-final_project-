Monopoly effects can also emerge in the market. He pointed to the case of goldsmiths, who earned much higher wages than workers of a similar skill because they were perceived to be trustworthy ― a characteristic that is rare and not easily provable. This created a significant barrier to entry so that those working with gold could demand a monopoly price for their services. Mill realized that the goldsmiths’ situation was not an isolated case. He noted that large sections of the working classes were barred from entering skilled professions because they entailed many years of education and training. The cost of supporting someone through this process was out of reach for most families, so those who could afford it were able to enjoy wages far above what might be expected. [3점]* monopoly: 독점",

If people guess the weight of a cow and put it on a slip of paper, or estimate the likelihood of a revolution in Pakistan and enter it into a website, the average of their views is highly accurate. But, surprisingly, if those people talk about these questions in a group, the answers that they come to are increasingly incorrect.
