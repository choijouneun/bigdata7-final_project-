While we are proud of our school’s history, the facilities are not exactly what they should be for modern schooling. Thanks to a generous donation to the school foundation, we will be able to start renovating those parts of our campus that have become outdated. We hope this will help provide our students with the best education possible. I’m writing to inform you that the auditorium will be the first building closed for repairs. Students will not be able to use the auditorium for about one month while the repairs are taking place. We hope that you will understand how this brief inconvenience will encourage community­wide benefits for years to come.Sincerely,Vice Principal Kyla Andrews",

        "paragraph": "Without guidance from their teacher, students will not embark on a journey of personal development that recognizes the value of cooperation. Left to their own devices, they will instinctively become increasingly competitive with each other. They will compare scores, reports, and feedback within the classroom environment ―just as they do in the sporting arena. We don’t need to teach our students about winners and losers. The playground and the media do that for them. However, we do need to teach them that there is more to life than winning and about the skills they need for successful cooperation. A group working together successfully requires individuals with a multitude of social skills, as well as a high level of interpersonal awareness. While some students inherently bring a natural understanding of these skills with them, they are always in the minority. To bring cooperation between peers into your classroom, you need to teach these skills consciously and carefully, and nurture them continuously throughout the school years.",

For example, to do its best work, a team needs deep knowledge of subjects relevant to the problem it’s trying to solve, and a mastery of the processes involved. But at the same time, the team needs fresh perspectives that are unencumbered by the prevailing wisdom or established ways of doing things. Often called a “beginner’s mind,” this is the newcomers’ perspective: people who are curious, even playful, and willing to ask anything — no matter how naive the question may seem — because they don’t know what they don’t know.

In 1982, artist Agnes Denes decided to return that landfill back to its roots, although temporarily. Denes was commissioned by the Public Art Fund to create one of the most significant and fantastical pieces of public work Manhattan has ever seen. Her concept was not a traditional sculpture, but a living installation that changed the way the public looked at art. In the name of art, Denes put a beautiful golden wheat field right in the shadow of the gleaming Twin Towers. For Wheatfield — A Confrontation, Denes and volunteers removed trash from four acres of land, then planted amber waves of grain atop the area. After months of farming and irrigation, the wheat field was thriving and ready. The artist and her volunteers harvested thousands of pounds of wheat to give to food banks in the city, nourishing both the minds and bodies of New Yorkers.",

She decided to concentrate on ophthalmology, which is the branch of medicine that works with eye diseases and disorders. As her career progressed, Bath taught students in medical schools and trained other doctors. In 1976, she co­founded the American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness (AiPB) with the basic principle that “eyesight is a basic human right.” In the 1980s, Bath began researching the use of lasers in eye treatments.

(A) They manage this feat through a combination of trade, to support their way of life, and geographic isolation. The Inuit occupy remote territory, removed from major population centers of Canada. If cross­cultural contact were to become sufficiently close, the Inuit ethos would disappear. (B) Rather, an ethos results from the interdependent acts of many individuals. This cluster of produced meaning may require some degree of insulation from larger and wealthier outside forces. The Canadian Inuit maintain their own ethos, even though they number no more than twenty­four thousand. (C) Distinct cultural groups of similar size do not, in the long run, persist in downtown Toronto, Canada, where they come in contact with many outside influences and pursue essentially Western paths for their lives.

That means that little creatures have to produce heat more rapidly than large creatures. (A) Despite the vast differences in heart rates, nearly all mammals have about 800 million heartbeats in them if they live an average life. The exception is humans. We pass 800 million heartbeats after twenty­five years, and just keep on going for another fifty years and 1.6 billion heartbeats or so. (B) They must therefore lead completely different lifestyles. An elephant’s heart beats just thirty times a minute, a human’s sixty, a cow’s between fifty and eighty, but a mouse’s beats six hundred times a minute — ten times a second. Every day, just to survive, the mouse must eat about 50 percent of its own body weight. (C) We humans, by contrast, need to consume only about 2 percent of our body weight to supply our energy requirements. One area where animals are curiously uniform is with the number of heartbeats they have in a lifetime. [3점]",

This positive boost in the participants’ willingness to cooperate was induced regardless of whether they liked the music or not. When people are in a more positive state of mind, they tend to become more agreeable and creative, while those on the opposite spectrum tend to focus on their individual problems rather than giving attention to solving group problems. The rhythm of music has a strong pull on people’s behavior. This is because when people listen to music with a steady pulse, they tend to match their actions to the beat.
