But in fact, they backtrack, returning to versions that they had earlier discarded as inadequate. In Beethoven’s most celebrated work, the Fifth Symphony, he scrapped the conclusion of the first movement because it felt too short, only to come back to it later. Had Beethoven been able to distinguish an extraordinary from an ordinary work, he would have accepted his composition immediately as a hit. When Picasso was painting his famous Guernica in protest of fascism, he produced 79 different drawings. Many of the images in the painting were based on his early sketches, not the later variations. If Picasso could judge his creations as he produced them, he would get consistently “warmer” and use the later drawings. But in reality, it was just as common that he got “colder.”",

        "paragraph": "The psychology professor Dr. Kelly Lambert’s research explains that keeping what she calls the “effort­driven rewards circuit” well engaged helps you deal with challenges in the environment around you or in your emotional life more effectively and efficiently. Doing hands­on activities that produce results you can see and touch ― such as knitting a scarf, cooking from scratch, or tending a garden ―fuels the reward circuit so that it functions optimally. She argues that the documented increase in depression among Americans may be directly correlated with the decline of purposeful physical activity. When we work with our hands, it increases the release of the neurochemicals dopamine and serotonin, both responsible for generating positive emotions. She also explains that working with our hands gives us a greater sense of control over our environment and more connection to the world around us. All of which contributes to a reduction in stress and anxiety and builds resilience against the onset of depression.",

        "paragraph": "It has long been held that the capacity for laughter is a peculiarly human characteristic. The witty Lucian of Samosata (2nd century A.D.) noted that the way to distinguish a man from a donkey is that one laughs and the other does not. In all societies humor is important not only in individual communication but also as a molding force of social groups, reinforcing their norms and regulating behavior. “Each particular time, each era, in fact each moment, has its own condition and themes for laughter . . .because of the major preoccupations, concerns, interests, activities, relations, and mode prevailing at the time.” The ultimate goal of anyone who studies another culture, such as ancient Greece, is to understand the people themselves who were more than the sum total of monuments, historical incidents, or social groupings. One way to approach this goal directly is to study the culture’s humor. As Goethe aptly observed: “Men show their characters in nothing more clearly than in what they think laughable.”",

        "paragraph": "Since the early 1980s, Black Friday has been a kind of unofficial U.S. holiday marking the beginning of the holiday season and, consequently, the most profitable time for retailers in the year. But in recent years, a new movement has come to light, adding a more ecological philosophy. The movement is called Green Friday, and it seeks to raise awareness about the damage that Black Friday brings to the environment. Think of the carbon emissions caused by driving to the mall, the shipping of millions of items around the world, the plastic waste produced by packaging, and even the long­term waste produced by mindlessly buying things we don’t need. Green Friday is about changing the way we see this day and switching our mindset from “buy, buy, buy” to finding alternative ways to give gifts during the holiday season so we don’t cause further damage to the Earth.

You’d find the holes left by the darts to be more or less evenly distributed across the map. But the real map of any given industry looks nothing like that; it looks more as if someone had thrown all the darts in the same place. This is probably in part because of reputation; buyers may be suspicious of a software firm in the middle of the cornfields. It would also be hard to recruit workers if every time you needed a new employee you had to persuade someone to move across the country, rather than just poach one from your neighbor. There are also regulatory reasons: zoning laws often try to concentrate dirty industries in one place and restaurants and bars in another.

Separating yourself from an emotionally upsetting situation gives you the space you need to better understand what you are truly feeling so you can more clearly articulate your emotions in a logical and less emotional way. A time­out also helps . When confronted with situations that don’t allow us to deal with our emotions or that cause us to suppress them, we may transfer those feelings to other people or situations at a later point. For instance, if you had a bad day at work, you may suppress your feelings at the office, only to find that you release them by getting into a fight with your kids or spouse when you get home later that evening. Clearly, your anger didn’t originate at home, but you released it there.

Scientists placed 28 dogs in front of a computer monitor blocked by an opaque screen, then played a recording of the dog’s human guardian or a stranger saying the dog’s name five times through speakers in the monitor. Finally, the screen was removed to reveal either the face of the dog’s human companion or a stranger’s face. The dogs’ reactions were videotaped. Naturally, the dogs were attentive to the sound of their name, and they typically stared about six seconds at the face after the screen was removed. But they spent significantly more time gazing at a strange face after they had heard the familiar voice of their guardian. That they paused for an extra second or two suggests that they realized something was wrong. The conclusion drawn is that dogs form a picture in their mind, and that they can think about it and make predictions based on that picture.

Many social enterprises are for instance reluctant to make use of traditional commercial finance products, fearing that they might not be able to pay back the loans. In addition, a significant number of social enterprise leaders report that relying too much on grant funding can be a risky strategy since individual grants are time limited and are not reliable in the long term.

This process, called adaptation, is one of the organizing principles operating throughout the central nervous system.(B) For example, if you place one hand in hot water and the other in iced water for some time before immersing them both into lukewarm water, you will experience conflicting sensations of temperature because of the relative change in the receptors registering hot and cold.(C) It explains why you can’t see well inside a dark room if you have come in from a sunny day. Your eyes have to become accustomed to the new level of luminance. Adaptation explains why apples taste sour after eating sweet chocolate and why traffic seems louder in the city if you normally live in the country.* calibrate: 조정하다 ** luminance: (빛의) 밝기",

If you resist accepting the change it is because you are afraid; afraid of losing something.(A) To learn to let go, to not cling and allow the flow of the river, is to live without resistances; being the creators of constructive changes that bring about improvements and widen our horizons. (B) In life, all these things come and go and then others appear, which will also go. It is like a river in constant movement. If we try to stop the flow, we create a dam; the water stagnates and causes a pressure which accumulates inside us. (C) Perhaps you might lose your position, property, possession, or money. The change might mean that you lose privileges or prestige. Perhaps with the change you lose the closeness of a person or a place.* stagnate: (물이) 고이다",

To begin with, the team measured the seriousness of each participant’s hobby, asking them to rate their agreement with statements like “I regularly train for this activity,” and also assessed how similar the demands of their job and hobby were. Then, each month for seven months, participants recorded how many hours they had dedicated to their activity, and completed a scale measuring their belief in their ability to effectively do their job, or their “self­efficacy.” The researchers found that when participants spent longer than normal doing their leisure activity, their belief in their ability to perform their job increased.

When their hobby was both serious and similar to their job, then spending more time on it actually decreased their self­efficacy.Research suggests that spending more time on serious hobbies can boost    (A)    at work if the hobbies and the job are sufficiently    (B)   .(A)(B)",
