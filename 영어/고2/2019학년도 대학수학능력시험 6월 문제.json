He says, “Incredibly beautiful!” stretching his hand out to touch the icy wall. Suddenly, his footing gives way and he slides down into the darkness.

She spends hours each day working on her skill, but she keeps being asked about her Instagram following. This is because businesses are always looking for easier and cheaper ways to market their products. A comedian with 100,000 followers can promote her upcoming show and increase the chances that people will buy tickets to come see her. This reduces the amount of money the comedy club has to spend on promoting the show and makes the management more likely to choose her over another comedian. Plenty of people are upset that follower count seems to be more important than talent, but it’s really about firing on all cylinders. In today’s version of show business, the business part is happening online. You need to adapt, because those who don’t adapt won’t make it very far.",

Many times people will surprise you with their willingness to help you out, so never assume that other people don’t care about your stress. Let them know honestly how you are feeling and allow yourself some opportunities to avoid responsibility and give yourself a chance to relax.",

        "question": "Without money, people could only barter. Many of us barter to a small extent, when we return favors.(A) There is no need to find someone who wants what you have to trade; you simply pay for your goods with money. The seller can then take the money and buy from someone else. Money is transferable and deferrable― the seller can hold on to it and buy when the time is right.(B) What would happen if you wanted a loaf of bread and all you had to trade was your new car?",
        "paragraph": "Barter depends on the double coincidence of wants, where not only does the other person happen to have what I want, but I also have what he wants. Money solves all these problems. (C) A man might offer to mend his neighbor’s broken door in return for a few hours of babysitting, for instance. Yet it is hard to imagine these personal exchanges working on a larger scale.* barter: 물물 교환(하다)",

        "question": "37 Brain research provides a framework for understanding how the brain processes and internalizes athletic skills.(A) This internalization transfers the swing from a consciously controlled left­brain function to a more intuitive or automatic right­brain function. This description, despite being an oversimplification of the actual processes involved, serves as a model for the interaction between conscious and unconscious actions in the brain, as it learns to perfect an athletic skill.(B) In practicing a complex movement such as a golf swing, we experiment with different grips, positions and swing movements, analyzing each in terms of the results it yields. This is a conscious, left­brain process.(C) Once we identify those elements of the swing that produce the desired results, we rehearse them over and over again in an attempt to record them permanently in “muscle memory.” In this way, we internalize the swing as a kinesthetic feeling that we trust to recreate the desired swing on demand.

        "paragraph": "Intergroup contact is more likely to reduce stereotyping and create favorable attitudes if it is backed by social norms that promote equality among groups. If the norms support openness, friendliness, and mutual respect, the contact has a greater chance of changing attitudes and reducing prejudice than if they do not. Institutionally supported intergroup contact ― that is, contact sanctioned by an outside authority or by established customs ― is more likely to produce positive changes than unsupported contact. Without institutional support, members of an in­group may be reluctant to interact with outsiders because they feel doing so is deviant or simply inappropriate. With the presence of institutional support, however, contact between groups is more likely to be seen as appropriate, expected, and worthwhile. For instance, with respect to desegregation in elementary schools, there is evidence that students were more highly motivated and learned more in classes conducted by teachers (that is, authority figures) who supported rather than opposed desegregation.* sanction: 승인하다  ** desegregation: 인종 차별 폐지Backed by social norms that pursue intergroup equality, intergroup contact tends to weaken    (A)    more, especially when it is led by     (B)     support.(A)(B)",
