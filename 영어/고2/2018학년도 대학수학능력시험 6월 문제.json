Here’s how she put it: “Just when I think I have it down, then something changes, and I have to make major adjustments. Parenting well feels like a moving target.” Patricia is correct. In fact, much research has been done on the developmental stages of childhood. Babies learn to sit up, then crawl, and finally walk. Kids have a greater ability to reason as they get older, and logic makes sense as they move further into preadolescence. A logical implication of these developmental changes is that parents will need to make parenting shifts along the way. In other words, the one strategy to keep in mind as your children grow and change is that you must also change to meet their new developmental needs and abilities.",

To make matters worse, because of a recent tropical storm, all telephone and Internet services were down. She had no way to get money, so decided to go knocking door to door, explaining that she needed a place to stay until she could contact her family back in Japan to send her some money. Everybody told her they had no space or extra food and pointed her in the direction of the next house. It was already dark when she arrived at a small roadside restaurant. The owner of the restaurant heard her story and really empathized. Much to her delight, Masami was invited in. The owner gave her some food, and allowed her to stay there until she could contact her parents.",

        "paragraph": "The development of writing was pioneered not by gossips, storytellers, or poets, but by accountants. The earliest writing system has its roots in the Neolithic period, when humans first began to switch from hunting and gathering to a settled lifestyle based on agriculture. This shift began around 9500 B.C. in a region known as the Fertile Crescent, which stretches from modern‑day Egypt, up to southeastern Turkey, and down again to the border between Iraq and Iran. Writing seems to have evolved in this region from the custom of using small clay pieces to account for transactions involving agricultural goods such as grain, sheep, and cattle. The first written documents, which come from the Mesopotamian city of Uruk and date back to around 3400 B.C., record amounts of bread, payment of taxes, and other transactions using simple symbols and marks on clay tablets.* transaction: 거래",

Many of the stories have to do with some kind of stereotype. You can speak with a refugee, a soldier suffering from PTSD, and a homeless person.

This is foolish, of course, because in reality, things don’t happen more frequently just because we can imagine them more easily. Thanks to this prejudice, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map in our heads. Thus, we overestimate the risk of being the victims of a plane crash, a car accident, or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying from less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer. The chances of bomb attacks are much rarer than we think, and the chances of suffering depression are much higher. We attach too much likelihood to spectacular, flashy, or loud outcomes. Anything silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. Our brains imagine impressive outcomes more readily than ordinary ones.",

The planes that returned tended to have bullet holes along the wings, body, and tail, and commanders wanted to reinforce those areas because they seemed to get hit most often. Wald, however, saw that the important thing was that these bullet holes had not destroyed the planes, and what needed more protection were . Those were the parts where, if a plane was struck by a bullet, it would never be seen again. His calculations based on that logic are still in use today, and they have saved many pilots.

What he found was that the ‘lucky’ people were good at spotting opportunities. In one experiment he told both groups to count the number of pictures in a newspaper. The ‘unlucky’ diligently ground their way through the task; the ‘lucky’ usually noticed that the second page contained an announcement that said: “Stop counting — there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” On a later page, the ‘unlucky’ were also too busy counting images to spot a note reading: “Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this, and win $250.” Wiseman’s conclusion was that, when faced with a challenge, ‘unlucky’ people were less flexible.

Dr. Hoagland was curious enough to notice that whenever he left his wife’s room for a short while, she complained that he had been gone for a long time. In the interest of scientific investigation, he asked his wife to count to 60, with each count corresponding to what she felt was one second, while he kept a record of her temperature. His wife reluctantly accepted and he quickly noticed that the hotter she was, the faster she counted. When her temperature was 38 degrees Celsius, for instance, she counted to 60 in 45 seconds. He repeated the experiment a few more times, and found that when her temperature reached 39.5 degrees Celsius, she counted one minute in just 37 seconds. The doctor thought that his wife must have some kind of ‘internal clock’ inside her brain that ran faster as the fever went up. The results of Dr. Hoagland’s investigation showed that his wife felt    (A)    time had passed than actually had as her body temperature    (B)   .(A)(B)",
