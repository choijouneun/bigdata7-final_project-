But it was no longer just one cloud. It appeared as though the entire sky had turned dark. Their innocent spring shower had turned into a raging thunderstorm. “Maybe we should go back the direction we came from,” Sadie said, panicked. “Do you know which way we came ” Lauren asked, her eyes darting around. Sadie’s heart fell. Sadie realized with anxiety that she didn’t even know where she’d taken her last ten steps from. Every angle looked exactly the same. Every tree a twin to the one beside it.

Scooter companies provide safety regulations, but the regulations aren’t always followed by the riders. Students can be reckless while they ride, some even having two people on one scooter at a time. Universities already have certain regulations, such as walk­only zones, to restrict motorized modes of transportation. However, they need to do more to target motorized scooters specifically. To ensure the safety of students who use electric scooters, as well as those around them, officials should look into reinforcing stricter regulations, such as having traffic guards flagging down students and giving them warning when they violate the regulations.",

        "paragraph": "Humans are omnivorous, meaning that they can consume and digest a wide selection of plants and animals found in their surroundings. The primary advantage to this is that they can adapt to nearly all earthly environments. The disadvantage is that no single food provides the nutrition necessary for survival. Humans must be flexible enough to eat a variety of items sufficient for physical growth and maintenance, yet cautious enough not to randomly ingest foods that are physiologically harmful and, possibly, fatal. This dilemma, the need to experiment combined with the need for conservatism, is known as the omnivore’s paradox. It results in two contradictory psychological impulses regarding diet. The first is an attraction to new foods; the second is a preference for familiar foods.",

But using a recorder has some disadvantages and is not always the best solution. If the interview lasts a while, listening to it again to select the quotes you wish to use can be time­consuming, especially if you are working to a tight deadline. It is often more efficient to develop the technique (using a recorder as backup if you wish) of selective note­taking. This involves writing down the key answers from an interview so that they can be transcribed easily afterwards. It is sensible to take down more than you think you’ll need, but try to get into the habit of editing out the material you are not going to need as the interview proceeds.

A certain amount of intellectual property law is plainly necessary to achieve this. But it has gone too far. Most patents are now as much about defending monopoly and discouraging rivals as about sharing ideas. And that disrupts innovation. Many firms use patents as barriers to entry, suing upstart innovators who trespass on their intellectual property even on the way to some other goal. In the years before World War I, aircraft makers tied each other up in patent lawsuits and slowed down innovation until the US government stepped in. Much the same has happened with smartphones and biotechnology today. New entrants have to fight their way through “patent thickets” if they are to build on existing technologies to make new ones.* trespass: 침해하다",

        "paragraph": "The earliest challenges and contests to solve important problems in mathematics date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Some of these problems have continued to challenge mathematicians until modern times. For example, Pierre de Fermat issued a set of mathematical challenges in 1657, many on prime numbers and divisibility. The solution to what is now known as Fermat’s Last Theorem was not established until the late 1990s by Andrew Wiles. David Hilbert, a German mathematician, identified 23 unsolved problems in 1900 with the hope that these problems would be solved in the twenty­first century. Although some of the problems were solved, others remain unsolved to this day. More recently, in 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute named seven mathematical problems that had not been solved with the hope that they could be solved in the twenty­first century. A $1 million prize will be awarded for solving each of these seven problems.",

He graduated from Harvard College in 1939 and later became the youngest editor ever hired by The Saturday Evening Post.

He founded The Fund for Animals in 1967, and he served as its president, without pay, until his death in 1998. He always dreamed of a place where animals could roam free and live in caring conditions.

        "question": "You know that forks don’t fly off to the Moon and that neither apples nor anything else on Earth cause the Sun to crash down on us. (A) The Earth has more mass than tables, trees, or apples, so almost everything in the world is pulled towards the Earth. That’s why apples fall from trees. Now, you might know that the Sun is much bigger than Earth and has much more mass.(B) The reason these things don’t happen is that the strength of gravity’s pull depends on two things. The first is the mass of the object. The apple is very small, and doesn’t have much mass, so its pull on the Sun is absolutely tiny, certainly much smaller than the pull of all the planets. (C) So why don’t apples fly off towards the Sun?",
        "paragraph": "The reason is that the pull of gravity also depends on the distance to the object doing the pulling. Although the Sun has much more mass than the Earth, we are much closer to the Earth, so we feel its gravity more.",

        "question": "37 Testing strategies relating to direct assessment of content knowledge still have their value in an inquiry­driven classroom.(A) For these reasons, we need a measure of a student’s content understanding. To do this right, we need to make sure our assessment is getting us accurate measures of whether our students understand the content they use in an inquiry.(B) However, it also could be that they did not understand the content that they were trying to build patterns with. Sometimes students will understand the processes of inquiry well, and be capable of skillfully applying social studies disciplinary strategies, yet fail to do so because they misinterpret the content. (C) Let’s pretend for a moment that we wanted to ignore content and only assess a student’s skill with investigations. The problem is that the skills and the content are interconnected. When a student fails at pattern analysis, it could be because they do not understand how to do the pattern analysis properly. * inquiry­driven classroom: 탐구 주도형 교실",

This is a perfectly normal psychological tick ― an oxymoron called “cute aggression” ― and even though it sounds cruel, it’s not about causing harm at all. In fact, strangely enough, this compulsion may actually make us more caring. The first study to look at cute aggression in the human brain has now revealed that this is a complex neurological response, involving several parts of the brain. The researchers propose that cute aggression may stop us from becoming so emotionally overloaded that we are unable to look after things that are super cute. “Cute aggression may serve as a tempering mechanism that allows us to function and actually take care of something we might first perceive as overwhelmingly cute,” explains the lead author, Stavropoulos. * oxymoron: 모순 어법According to research, cute aggression may act as a neurological response to (A) excessive emotions and make us (B) for cute creatures.
