        "paragraph": "We have constructed so many large reservoirs to hold water, and they are located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere rather than randomly around the globe. As a result, enough of Earth’s mass has shifted to speed up its rotation. Currently, 88 huge reservoirs hold some 10 trillion tons of water. Before the reservoirs were built, this water was located in the ocean, which has most of its mass in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls her arms in to turn faster. Because natural factors in the environment, such as the pull of tides, are gradually slowing Earth’s rotation, the human influence is accidentally working against the natural rate of deceleration. The shift in Earth’s mass has also changed the location of the axis on which Earth rotates.",

Primary school teachers do a good job of providing feedback in reports, but as soon as grades take over from narrative comments as the main method of evaluation, students and parents begin to lose out. When teachers offer information such as “You did a great job of planning your ideas for this paper, and formulating your main argument, but your body paragraphs don’t address the question raised by the argument,” in response to a rough draft of a paper, the student has information that praises the positive elements, addresses failures, and gives useful information for her better performance. In this way, informational feedback works much like praise for efforts, and similarly boosts enthusiasm for the task and later performance.",

You would find it very difficult indeed to describe the inside of your friend, even though you feel you know such a great friend through and through.

At the time of its completion, it was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world. Workers encountered a number of difficulties during the construction period, including soft ground and pockets of gas. Soft ground caused a sudden collapse that killed six workers in early 1905. Despite these obstacles, the tunnelers made good progress, achieving a record by cutting through 449 feet of granite in one month. President William Howard Taft conducted the opening on September 23, 1909, pressing the switch that released the first water.

        "question": "36 Twins provide a unique opportunity to study genes. Some pairs of twins are identical: they share the exact same genes in their DNA. (A) In the same way, scientists can estimate the role genes play in any other trait by comparing the similarity of identical twins to the similarity of fraternal twins. If there is a difference, then the magnitude of the difference gives a clue as to how much genes are involved. (B) Other pairs are fraternal, sharing only half of their genes on average. Differences in genetic similarity turn out to be a powerful natural experiment, allowing us to estimate how much genes influence a given trait. (C) For example, identical twins almost always have the same eye color, but fraternal twins often do not. This suggests that genes play a role in eye color, and in fact geneticists have identified several specific genes that are involved.",

        "question": "37 For years business leaders and politicians have portrayed environmental protection and jobs as mutually exclusive. (A) Pollution control, protection of natural areas and endangered species, and limits on use of nonrenewable resources, they claim, will choke the economy and throw people out of work. Ecological economists dispute this claim, however. (B) Recycling, for instance, makes more new jobs than extracting raw materials. This doesn’t necessarily mean that recycled goods are more expensive than those from raw resources. We’re simply substituting labor in the recycling center for energy and huge machines used to extract new materials in remote places.(C) Their studies show that only 0.1 percent of all large-scale layoffs in the United States in recent years were due to government regulations. Environmental protection, they argue, not only is necessary for a healthy economic system, but it actually creates jobs and stimulates business. [3점]",

For example, advertisers often use the results of surveys to prove what they say about their products. Sometimes they claim a level of precision not based reliably on evidence. So, if a company selling washing powder claims 95.45% of British adults agree that this powder washes whiter than any other, then this level of precision is clearly inappropriate. It is unlikely that all British adults were surveyed, so the results are based only on a sample and not the whole population. At best the company should be claiming that over 95% of those asked agreed that their powder washes whiter than any other. Even if the whole population had been surveyed, to have given the result to two decimal points would have been absurd. The effect is to propose a high degree of scientific precision in the research. Frequently, however, inappropriate precision is an attempt to mask the unscientific nature of a study. * decimal point: 소수점󰀻Advertisers often give us information with a(n) (A) precision, but it can be considered as an intention to conceal the lack of (B) of their research.

        "text": "Although organisms interact with their surroundings in many ways, certain factors may be critical to a particular species’ success. A shortage or absence of this factor restricts the success of the species; thus, it is known as a limiting factor. Limiting factors can be quite different from one species to another. The limiting factor for many species of fish is the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. In a swiftly flowing, tree-lined mountain stream, the level of dissolved oxygen is high and so provides a favorable environment for trout. As the stream continues down the mountain, the steepness of the slope decreases, which results in fewer rapids where the water tumbles over rocks and becomes oxygenated. In addition, as the stream becomes wider, the canopy of trees over the stream usually is thinner, allowing more sunlight to reach the stream and warm the water. Warm water cannot hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water. Therefore, slower-flowing, warm-water streams contain less oxygen than rapidly moving, cool streams. Fish such as black bass and walleye are adapted to such areas, since they are able to tolerate lower oxygen concentrations and higher water temperatures. Trout are not able to survive under such conditions and are not found in warm, less well-oxygenated water.
