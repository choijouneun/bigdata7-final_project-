We all stopped dinner, and we squeezed into the basement. The siren kept screaming and the roar of planes was heard in the sky. The terror of war was overwhelming.

There is a big difference between remembering your four jokes and recognizing or understanding thousands.

It can be used in different ways such as requesting donations for a worthy cause anywhere in the world and generating funding for a project with the contributors then becoming partners in the project. In essence, crowdfunding is the fusion of social networking and venture capitalism. In just the same way as social networks have rewritten the conventional rules about how people communicate and interact with each other, crowdfunding in all its variations has the potential to rewrite the rules on how businesses and other projects get funded in the future. Crowdfunding can be viewed as the democratization of business financing. Instead of restricting capital sourcing and allocation to a relatively small and fixed minority, crowdfunding empowers everyone connected to the Internet to access both the collective wisdom and the pocket money of everyone else who connects to the Internet.",

After a closer look, you realize that they too face challenges and problems. They are under the same amount of pressure and stress as you. One word makes a world of difference: attitude! Attitude is your psychological disposition, a proactive way to approach life. It is a personal predetermination not to let anything or anyone take control of your life or manipulate your mood. Attitude allows you to anticipate, excuse, forgive and forget, without being naive or stupid. It is a personal decision to stay in control and not to lose your temper. Attitude provides safe conduct through all kinds of storms. It helps you to get up every morning happy and determined to get the most out of a brand new day. Whatever happens ― good or bad ― the proper attitude makes the difference. It may not always be easy to have a positive attitude; nevertheless, you need to remember you can face a kind or cruel world based on your perception and your actions. * safe conduct: 안전 통행권",

Our dangers today are, for example, high blood pressure or diabetes. To be clear, we have a Stone Age brain that lives in a modern world. Because of this, many situations are considered a threat by our brains, although they are harmless to our survival. In the past, danger meant we either had to flee or fight. If we have an appointment but are stuck in a traffic jam, that does not really threaten our lives. However, our brain considers this a danger. That is the point. There is no danger, but our brain rates it as such. If we have an unpleasant conversation with our partner, it does not threaten our lives, and we do not have to flee or fight.

        "paragraph": "There has been a general belief that sport is a way of reducing violence. Anthropologist Richard Sipes tests this notion in a classic study of the relationship between sport and violence. Focusing on what he calls “combative sports,” those sports including actual body contact between opponents or simulated warfare, he hypothesizes that if sport is an alternative to violence, then one would expect to find an inverse correlation between the popularity of combative sports and the frequency and intensity of warfare. In other words, the more combative sports (e.g., football, boxing) the less likely warfare. Using the Human Relations Area Files and a sample of 20 societies, Sipes tests the hypothesis and discovers a significant relationship between combative sports and violence, but a direct one, not the inverse correlation of his hypothesis. According to Sipes’ analysis, the more pervasive and popular combative sports are in a society, the more likely that society is to engage in war. So, Sipes draws the obvious conclusion that combative sports are not alternatives to war but rather are reflections of the same aggressive impulses in human society.",

To Edison’s astonishment, it failed. Edison had not taken into account legislators’ habits. They didn’t like to vote quickly and efficiently. They liked to lobby their fellow legislators as voting took place. Edison had a great idea, but he completely misunderstood the needs of his customers.

        "paragraph": "Psychologist John Bargh did an experiment showing human perception and behavior can be influenced by external factors. He told a bunch of healthy undergraduates that he was testing their language abilities. He presented them with a list of words and asked them to create a coherent sentence from it. One of the lists was “DOWN SAT LONELY THE MAN WRINKLED BITTERLY THE WITH FACE OLD”. “Bitterly, the lonely old man with the wrinkled face sat down” is one possible solution. But this was no linguistics test. Bargh was interested in how long it took the students to leave the lab and walk down the hall after they were exposed to the words. What he found was extraordinary. Those students who had been exposed to an “elderly” mix of words took almost 40 percent longer to walk down the hall than those who had been exposed to “random” words. Some students even walked with their shoulders bent forwards, dragging their feet as they left, as if they were 50 years older than they actually were.  In an experiment about human perception and behavior, participants who experienced (A) to words related to “elderly” showed pace, and some of them even showed posture,(B)to what the words suggested.(A)(B)(A)(B)",
