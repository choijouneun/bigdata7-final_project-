Empathizing with employees in order to understand their point of view can be very helpful. However, when dealing with a problem area, in particular, remember that it is not the person who is bad, but the actions exhibited on the job. Avoid making suggestions to employees about personal traits they should change; instead suggest more acceptable ways of performing. For example, instead of focusing on a person’s “unreliability,” a manager might focus on the fact that the employee “has been late to work seven times this month.” It is difficult for employees to change who they are; it is usually much easier for them to change how they act.",

It has headed off many of the domestic conflicts that such a large shift in gender roles and family dynamics was bound to spark. It has relieved other pressures in the household, including longer workdays and overscheduled children, and saved us time that we can now invest in other pursuits. It has also allowed us to diversify our diets substantially, making it possible even for people with no cooking skills and little money to enjoy a whole different cuisine.

He became an assistant to Le Verrier in 1858 and worked as a calculator. At nineteen, he wrote another book called The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds, in which he passionately claimed that life exists outside the planet Earth. His most successful work, Popular Astronomy, was published in 1880, and eventually sold 130,000 copies. With his own funds, he built an observatory at Juvisy and spent May to November of each year there.

        "question": "36 If you drive down a busy street, you will find many competing businesses, often right next to one another. For example, in most places a consumer in search of a quick meal has many choices, and more fast­food restaurants appear all the time. (A) Yes, costs rise, but consumers also gain information to help make purchasing decisions. Consumers also benefit from added variety, and we all get a product that’s pretty close to our vision of a perfect good — and no other market structure delivers that outcome. (B) However, this misconception doesn’t account for why firms advertise. In markets where competitors sell slightly differentiated products, advertising enables firms to inform their customers about new products and services. (C) These competing firms advertise heavily. The temptation is to see advertising as driving up the price of a product without any benefit to the consumer.",

This effect likely stems from differences in emotional arousal. The events of September 11th emotionally affected people throughout the United States.
