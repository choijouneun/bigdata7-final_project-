Colonies of several hundreds of ants show differences in the way they behave, just like individual people do. Researchers from the University of Arizona studied colonies of rock ants across the western US, both in the wild and in the lab. They found certain behaviors go together―for example, a colony that explores more widely for food also tends to respond more aggressively to an intruder. Such a colony has a more “risk­taking” personality and this is more common in the north, where the climate is colder. The study suggests those more adventurous personalities could be an adaptation to the limited period of activity caused by the long, snowy northern climate. [3점]",

        "question": "38 The subjective approach to probability is based mostly on opinions, feelings, or hopes. Therefore, we don’t typically use this approach in real scientific attempts.(A) But the probability of an event in either case is mostly subjective, and although this approach isn’t scientific, it sure makes for some great sports talk amongst the fans.(B) Although the actual probability that the Ohio State football team will win the national championship is out there somewhere, no one knows what it is. Some fans will have ideas about what that chance is based on how much they love or hate Ohio State.(C) Other people will take a slightly more scientific approach―evaluating players’ stats, analyzing all the statistics of the Ohio State team over the last 100 years, looking at the strength of the competition, and so on. * probability: 확률",

Chen went to work with seven male monkeys at a lab.(A) Once they learned how to use the coins, it turned out that individual monkeys had strong preferences for different treats. The monkey would exchange his coins for whichever food he preferred.(B) So Chen gave the monkey a coin and then showed a treat. Whenever the monkey gave the coin back to Chen, he got the treat. It took months, but the monkeys eventually learned that the coins could buy the treats.(C) When Chen gave a monkey a coin, he sniffed it and, after determining he couldn’t eat it, he tossed it aside. When Chen repeated this, the monkey started tossing the coin at him.",

The younger they are when they start using a brand or product, the more likely they are to keep using it for years to come.
