        "paragraph": "Studies by Vosniado and Brewer illustrate Fish is Fish­style assimilation in the context of young children’s thinking about the earth. They worked with children who believed that the earth is flat (because this fit their experiences) and attempted to help them understand that, in fact, it is spherical. When told it is round, children often pictured the earth as a pancake rather than as a sphere. If they were then told that it is round like a sphere, they interpreted the new information about a spherical earth within their flat­earth view by picturing a pancake­like flat surface inside or on top of a sphere, with humans standing on top of the pancake. The model of the earth that they had developed — and that helped them explain how they could stand or walk upon its surface — did not fit the model of a spherical earth. Like the story Fish is Fish, where a fish imagines everything on land to be fish­like, everything the children heard was incorporated into their preexisting views.",

According to Devereux and Ginsburg, laughing with strangers served to create a social bond that made each person in the pair feel comfortable. This explanation is supported by the fact that in their stranger condition, when one person laughed, the other was likely to laugh as well. Interestingly, the three social conditions (alone, paired with a stranger, or paired with a friend) did not differ in their ratings of funniness of the video or of feelings of happiness or anxiousness.

        "question": "36 The ancient Greeks used to describe two very different ways of thinking — logos and mythos. Logos roughly referred to the world of the logical, the empirical, the scientific.(A) But lots of scholars then and now — including many anthropologists, sociologists and philosophers today —see a more complicated picture, where mythos and logos are intertwined and interdependent. Science itself, according to this view, relies on stories.(B) Mythos referred to the world of dreams, storytelling and symbols. Like many rationalists today, some philosophers of Greece prized logos and looked down at mythos. Logic and reason, they concluded, make us modern; storytelling and mythmaking are primitive.(C) The frames and metaphors we use to understand the world shape the scientific discoveries we make; they even shape what we see. When our frames and metaphors change, the world itself is transformed. The Copernican Revolution involved more than just scientific calculation; it involved a new story about the place of Earth in the universe.* empirical: 경험적인",

        "question": "37 There is no doubt that the length of some literary works is overwhelming. Reading or translating a work in class, hour after hour, week after week, can be such a boring experience that many students never want to open a foreign language book again.(A) Moreover, there are some literary features that cannot be adequately illustrated by a short excerpt: the development of plot or character, for instance, with the gradual involvement of the reader that this implies; or the unfolding of a complex theme through the juxtaposition of contrasting views.(B) Extracts provide one type of solution. The advantages are obvious: reading a series of passages from different works produces more variety in the classroom, so that the teacher has a greater chance of avoiding monotony, while still giving learners a taste at least of an author’s special flavour.(C) On the other hand, a student who is only exposed to ‘bite­sized chunks’ will never have the satisfaction of knowing the overall pattern of a book, which is after all the satisfaction most of us seek when we read something in our own language.* excerpt: 발췌 ** juxtaposition: 병치",

Strangers stand further apart than do acquaintances, acquaintances stand further apart than friends, and friends stand further apart than romantic partners. Sometimes, of course, these rules are violated. Recall the last time you rode 20 stories in an elevator packed with total strangers. The sardine­like experience no doubt made the situation a bit uncomfortable. With your physical space violated, you may have tried to create “psychological” space by avoiding eye contact, focusing instead on the elevator buttons. By reducing closeness in one nonverbal channel (eye contact), one can compensate for unwanted closeness in another channel (proximity). Similarly, if you are talking with someone who is seated several feet away at a large table, you are likely to maintain constant eye contact —something you might feel uncomfortable doing if you were standing next to each other.* sardine­like: 승객이 빽빽이 들어찬  ** proximity: 근접성Physical distance between people is (A) by relationship status, but when the distance is not appropriate, people (B) their nonverbal communication to establish a comfortable psychological distance.(A)(B)(A)(B)",
