        "paragraph": "Competition makes the world go round. It is the engine of evolution and the foundation of democracy. It prompts innovation, drives global markets, and puts money in the pocket. Still, there are those who have argued that competition is a source of evil. They see competition in terms of destructiveness: they don’t believe it’s a constructive activity. They assert that competition kills off more prosocial behaviors, such as cooperation and respect. The assumption that competition is the opposite of cooperation is missing something crucial. To compete, both opponents have to cooperate on the rules: there’s a mutual agreement of cooperation that governs the competition. As well, competitions are commonly among teams; each individual needs to cooperate with team members in order to compete effectively. Healthy competition can’t happen without cooperation. In fact, the hormones that drive us to compete are the same hormones that drive us to collaborate.",

Perhaps you remember the folktale about the lazy son who gets scolded by his mother for losing the money he received as payment from a farmer. (A) For example, writing out your notes in full sentences makes sense if the goal is to study a textbook. But if you used the same plan for taking lecture notes, you’d move so slowly that you’d miss most of what the instructor said. The secret is to find a plan that fits your goal.(B) Anxious not to anger his mother, the boy dutifully pours the milk into his pocket. Although his mother’s plan was good, it could work only when used in the right circumstance. The same idea applies to your study plans. (C) “Next time you get paid,” his mother says sternly, “be sure to carry it home in your pocket.” But the following day the boy goes to work for a dairy farmer, who pays him with a pail of milk instead of money.",

Get the timing wrong, and the picture may well lose some of its energy. (A) But with other, less predictable, events there can be magical moments ― when constantly changing conditions and people suddenly come together to create a strong, beautiful, energetic composition. Such moments might be when two or more elements combine in a certain way. (B) For some subjects, the key times at which to take pictures are obvious, such as the moment when a winner crosses the finishing line. On such occasions, preparation and practice count as much as good luck. (C) On a stormy day, for example, a beautiful building might suddenly be illuminated by a shaft of light, creating a moody scene that might never be recaptured. To make the most of these decisive moments requires patience and the vision to see what might happen, even before it presents itself in the viewfinder. [3점]* composition: 구도",

The physicians were asked to decide to recommend either surgery or radiation for their patients with lung cancer. Half of the physicians were told, “The one-month survival rate for surgery is 90%.” Given this information, 84% of the physicians chose to recommend surgery over radiation. The other physicians were provided with this information about surgery outcomes: “There is a 10% mortality rate in the first month.” Given this latter information, only 50% of the physicians recommended surgery. As you may have realized, the two statements describe the same outcome. However, when the same outcome statistics are framed in terms of ‘survival,’ substantially more physicians choose the surgery. But when the outcomes are framed in terms of ‘mortality,’ the percentage of physicians who choose surgery drops greatly. This effect has been demonstrated in politics, medicine, advertising, and all areas in which people make decisions.󰀻Different ways of (A) the same information can influence the (B) that are based on the information.
