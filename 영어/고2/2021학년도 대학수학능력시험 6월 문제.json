It was every surfer’s worst nightmare — the fin of a shark. And it was no more than 20 meters away! He turned his board toward the beach and started kicking his way to the shore. Shivering, he gripped his board tighter and kicked harder. ‘I’m going to be okay,’ he thought to himself. ‘I need to let go of the fear.’ Five minutes of terror that felt like a lifetime passed before he was on dry land again. Dave sat on the beach and caught his breath. His mind was at ease. He was safe. He let out a contented sigh as the sun started setting behind the waves.* fin: 지느러미",

As parents, one of the dangers is comparing children unfavorably with each other, since they are always looking for a competitive advantage. The issue is not how fast a child can run, but who crosses the finish line first. A boy does not care how tall he is; he is vitally interested in who is tallest. Children systematically measure themselves against their peers on everything from skateboarding ability to who has the most friends. They are especially sensitive to any failure that is talked about openly within their own family. Accordingly, parents who want a little peace at home should guard against comparative comments that routinely favor one child over another. To violate this principle is to set up even greater rivalry between them.* sibling: 형제, 자매",

        "paragraph": "Author Elizabeth Gilbert tells the fable of a great saint who would lead his followers in meditation. Just as the followers were dropping into their zen moment, they would be disrupted by a cat that would walk through the temple meowing and bothering everyone. The saint came up with a simple solution: He began to tie the cat to a pole during meditation sessions. This solution quickly developed into a ritual: Tie the cat to the pole first, meditate second. When the cat eventually died of natural causes, a religious crisis followed. What were the followers supposed to do  How could they possibly meditate without tying the cat to the pole  This story illustrates what I call invisible rules. These are habits and behaviors that have unnecessarily rigidified into rules. Although written rules can be resistant to change, invisible ones are more stubborn. They’re the silent killers.* zen: (불교) 선(禪)  ** rigidify: 굳게 하다",

It’s a chain reaction of purchases. Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.

        "question": "36 Consider the story of two men quarreling in a library. One wants the window open and the other wants it closed. They argue back and forth about how much to leave it open: a crack, halfway, or three‑quarters of the way. (A) The librarian could not have invented the solution she did if she had focused only on the two men’s stated positions of wanting the window open or closed. Instead, she looked to their underlying interests of fresh air and no draft. (B) After thinking a minute, she opens wide a window in the next room, bringing in fresh air without a draft. This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties’ problem appears to be a conflict of positions, they naturally tend to talk about positions — and often reach an impasse. (C) No solution satisfies them both. Enter the librarian. She asks one why he wants the window open: “To get some fresh air.” She asks the other why he wants it closed: “To avoid a draft.” * draft: 외풍 ** impasse: 막다름",

        "question": "37 In one survey, 61 percent of Americans said that they supported the government spending more on ‘assistance to the poor’. (A) Therefore, the framing of a question can heavily influence the answer in many ways, which matters if your aim is to obtain a ‘true measure’ of what people think. And next time you hear a politician say ‘surveys prove that the majority of the people agree with me’, be very wary. (B) But when the same population was asked whether they supported spending more government money on ‘welfare’, only 21 percent were in favour. In other words, if you ask people about individual welfare programmes — such as giving financial help to people who have long‑term illnesses and paying for school meals for families with low income — people are broadly in favour of them.(C) But if you ask about ‘welfare’ — which refers to those exact same programmes that you’ve just listed — they’re against it. The word ‘welfare’ has negative connotations, perhaps because of the way many politicians and newspapers portray it.* wary: 조심성 있는 ** connotation: 함축",

She believed she could improve the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didn’t plan on talking to them at all. Thorndike designed a study to alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. She started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. She added water as an option to each one. Additionally, she placed baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations. Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped by 11.4 percent.
