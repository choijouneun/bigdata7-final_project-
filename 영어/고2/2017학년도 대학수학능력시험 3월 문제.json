It’s actually a term from archery, and it means “to miss the mark.” When we commit the “sin” of failing to take care of our bodies through proper nutrition, exercise, and rest, we’re missing the mark of what life is all about. Businesspeople will tell you that the individual who is in the best physical shape often wins in negotiations, because he has the physical stamina to see the deal through. One of the reasons world­class golfers are head and shoulders above the other golfers of their era is that they are in so much better shape than the others are. They work out not just on the practice range but in the weight room, which means that they have the strength and stamina to win not just the physical game but the mental game in order to close out their opponents in major tournaments.* practice range: 골프 연습장",

Long before Darwin published his work, social scientist Adam Smith had already considered that in business life, competition is the driving force behind economic efficiency and adaptation.

This was because, in fixing their targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England.

        "question": "37 The difference between selling and marketing is very simple. Selling focuses mainly on the firm’s desire to sell products for revenue. (A) When a product or service is marketed in the proper manner, very little selling is necessary because the consumer need already exists and the product or service is merely being produced to satisfy the need.(B) Salespeople and other forms of promotion are used to create demand for a firm’s current products. Clearly, the needs of the seller are very strong.(C) Marketing, however, focuses on the needs of the consumer, ultimately benefiting the seller as well. When a product or service is truly marketed, the needs of the consumer are considered from the very beginning of the new product development process, and the product­service mix is designed to meet the unsatisfied needs of the consuming public.* revenue: 수익",

Animals tend to be disturbed by unexpected and unpredictable events; quick movements and loud noises are particularly stressful. Animals that are regularly disturbed by visitors are more likely to tolerate your intrusion than those that have had little previous contact with humans. In Yellowstone National Park, for example, elk that live close to the town of Mammoth Hot Springs typically do not flee until cross­country skiers get within fifty feet. In more remote parts of the park, however, elk take flight when skiers are as much as a quarter mile away.* intrusion: 방해, 침범뾞The degree of animals’ (A)for the human disturbance depends on the (B)of their exposure to humans.(A)(B)",

Part of what is invigorating about the creative process is that it can start from humble materials and poor beginnings. There is a term in painting called “working with a limited palette;” a deliberate choice to work with fewer colors than actually available. With fewer options an artist can work more easily — less colors actually inspire her to creative resolutions. As a designer, I am often called upon to work with existing elements: logos, color palettes, slogans, etc. I see these limits as elements that actually help me; it is the limitations that help me free my creative imagination.

He has used chocolate syrup to render Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, and has recreated the Mona Lisa with peanut butter and jelly.
