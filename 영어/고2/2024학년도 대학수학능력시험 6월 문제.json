But as she started running, she received the baton smoothly. In the final 10 meters, she passed two other runners and crossed the finish line in first place!

As Goethe’s maxim goes, it is a great failing “to see yourself as more than you are.” How could you really be considered self­aware if you refuse to consider your weaknesses  Don’t fear self­assessment because you’re worried you might have to admit some things about yourself. The second half of Goethe’s maxim is important too. He states that it is equally damaging to “value yourself at less than your true worth.” We underestimate our capabilities just as much and just as dangerously as we overestimate other abilities. Cultivate the ability to judge yourself accurately and honestly. Look inward to discern what you’re capable of and what it will take to unlock that potential.* maxim: 격언",

Look instead at what they’re forced to trade in return ― look at what success has cost them. Mostly  Freedom. Their work demands they wear a suit. Their success depends on attending certain parties, kissing up to people they don’t like. It will require ―inevitably ― realizing they are unable to say what they actually think. Worse, it demands that they become a different type of person or do bad things. Sure, it might pay well — but they haven’t truly examined the transaction. As Seneca put it, “Slavery resides under marble and gold.” Too many successful people are prisoners in jails of their own making.

        "paragraph": "If a firm is going to be saved by the government, it might be easier to concentrate on lobbying the government for more money rather than taking the harder decision of restructuring the company to be able to be profitable and viable in the long term. This is an example of something known as moral hazard ― when government support alters the decisions firms take. For example, if governments rescue banks who get into difficulty, as they did during the credit crisis of 2007-08, this could encourage banks to take greater risks in the future because they know there is a possibility that governments will intervene if they lose money. Although the government rescue may be well intended, it can negatively affect the behavior of banks, encouraging risky and poor decision making.* viable: 성장할 수 있는",

What you need to do in that situation is find another way to think about the timeframe. For example, if it’s November and the deadline is in January, it’s better to tell yourself you have to get it done “this winter” rather than “next year.” The best approach is to view deadlines as a challenge that you have to meet within a period that’s imminent. That way the stress is more manageable, and you have a better chance of starting ― and therefore finishing ― in good time.* imminent: 임박한",

In 1845, he moved into a small self­built house near Walden Pond. At Walden, Thoreau did an incredible amount of reading. The journal he wrote there became the source of his most famous book, Walden. In his later life, Thoreau traveled to the Maine woods, to Cape Cod, and to Canada. At the age of 43, he ended his travels and returned to Concord.

        "question": "36 Brains are expensive in terms of energy. Twenty percent of the calories we consume are used to power the brain. (A) By directing your attention, they perform tricks with their hands in full view. Their actions should give away the game, but they can rest assured that your brain processes only small bits of the visual scene.(B) So brains try to operate in the most energy­efficient way possible, and that means processing only the minimum amount of information from our senses that we need to navigate the world. Neuroscientists weren’t the first to discover that fixing your gaze on something is no guarantee of seeing it. Magicians figured this out long ago.(C) This all helps to explain the prevalence of traffic accidents in which drivers hit pedestrians in plain view, or collide with cars directly in front of them. In many of these cases, the eyes are pointed in the right direction, but the brain isn’t seeing what’s really out there.* prevalence: 널리 행하여짐 ** pedestrian: 보행자 *** collide: 충돌하다",

        "question": "37 Buying a television is current consumption. It makes us happy today but does nothing to make us richer tomorrow. Yes, money spent on a television keeps workers employed at the television factory.(A) The crucial difference between these scenarios is that a college education makes a young person more productive for the rest of his or her life; a sports car does not. Thus, college tuition is an investment; buying a sports car is consumption.(B) But if the same money were invested, it would create jobs somewhere else, say for scientists in a laboratory or workers on a construction site, while also making us richer in the long run. (C) Think about college as an example. Sending students to college creates jobs for professors. Using the same money to buy fancy sports cars for high school graduates would create jobs for auto workers. [3점]",

        "paragraph": "Many things spark envy : ownership, status, health, youth, talent, popularity, beauty. It is often confused with jealousy because the physical reactions are identical. The difference: the subject of envy is a thing (status, money, health etc.). The subject of jealousy is the behaviour of a third person. Envy needs two people. Jealousy, on the other hand, requires three: Peter is jealous of Sam because the beautiful girl next door rings him instead. Paradoxically, with envy we direct resentments toward those who are most similar to us in age, career and residence. We don’t envy businesspeople from the century before last. We don’t envy millionaires on the other side of the globe. As a writer, I don’t envy musicians, managers or dentists, but other writers. As a CEO you envy other, bigger CEOs. As a supermodel you envy more successful supermodels.
