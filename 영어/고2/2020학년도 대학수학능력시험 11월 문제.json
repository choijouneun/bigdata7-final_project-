But when you think about it, you’ll realize that this doesn’t often work. As soon as someone figures out that you are on a mission to change their mind, the metaphorical shutters go down. You’ll have better luck if you ask well-chosen, open-ended questions that let someone challenge their own assumptions. We tend to approve of an idea if we thought of it first — or at least, if we think we thought of it first. Therefore, encouraging someone to question their own worldview will often yield better results than trying to force them into accepting your opinion as fact. Ask someone　well-chosen questions to look at their own views from another angle, and this might trigger fresh insights.",

        "paragraph": "In school, there’s one curriculum, one right way to study science, and one right formula that spits out the correct answer on a standardized test. Textbooks with grand titles like The Principles of Physics magically reveal “the principles” in three hundred pages. An authority figure then steps up to the lectern to feed us “the truth.” As theoretical physicist David Gross explained in his Nobel lecture, textbooks often ignore the many alternate paths that people wandered down, the many false clues they followed, the many misconceptions they had. We learn about Newton’s “laws” — as if they arrived by a grand divine visitation or a stroke of genius — but not the years he spent exploring, revising, and changing them. The laws that Newton failed to establish — most notably his experiments in alchemy, which attempted, and spectacularly failed, to turn lead into gold — don’t make the cut as part of the one-dimensional story told in physics classrooms. Instead, our education system turns the life stories of these scientists from lead to gold.* lectern: 강의대  ** alchemy: 연금술",

        "paragraph": "The vast majority of companies, schools, and organizations measure and reward “high performance” in terms of individual metrics such as sales numbers, résumé accolades, and test scores. The problem with this approach is that it is based on a belief we thought science had fully confirmed: that we live in a world of “survival of the fittest.” It teaches us that those with the best grades, or the most impressive résumé, or the highest point score, will be the ONLY ones to succeed. The formula is simple: be better and smarter and more creative than everyone else, and you will be successful. But this formula is inaccurate. Thanks to new research, we now know that achieving our highest potential is not about survival of the fittest but survival of the best fit. In other words, success is not just about how creative or smart or driven you are, but how well you are able to connect with, contribute to, and benefit from the ecosystem of people around you.* accolade: 수상, 표창",

Without knowing it, people who are lost will always walk in a circle. In the book Finding Your Way Without Map or Compass, author Harold Gatty confirms that this is true. We tend to walk in circles for several reasons. The most important is that virtually no human has two legs of the exact same length. One leg is always slightly longer than the other, and this causes us to turn without even noticing it. In addition, if you are hiking with a backpack on, the weight of that backpack will inevitably throw you off balance. Our dominant hand factors into the mix too. If you are right-handed, you will have a tendency to turn toward the right. And when you meet an obstacle, you will subconsciously decide to pass it on the right side.",

Coachman kept practicing hard and gained attention with her achievements in several competitions during her time in high school and college. In the 1948 London Olympics, Coachman competed in the high jump, reaching 5 feet, 6.5 inches, setting both an Olympic and an American record. This accomplishment made her the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal. She is in nine different Halls of Fame, including the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.

The appearance and subsequent evolution of exceedingly primitive living organisms (bacteria-like microbes and simple single-celled plants) began to change the atmosphere, liberating oxygen and breaking down carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. This made it possible for higher organisms to develop. When the earliest known plant cells with nuclei evolved about 2 billion years ago, the atmosphere seems to have had only about 1 percent of its present content of oxygen. With the emergence of the first land plants, about 500 million years ago, oxygen reached about one-third of its present concentration.

Since music can be extremely emotionally evocative, key life events can be emotionally heightened by the presence of music, ensuring that memories of the event become deeply encoded.

But in the Industrial Era our population exploded and we killed bison and elephants at industrial scale and in terrible numbers. The balance shifted greatly as a result. At present, we humans weigh more than 350 times as much as all bison and elephants put together. We weigh over ten times more than all the earth’s wild mammals combined. And if we add in all the mammals we’ve domesticated — cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, and so on — the comparison becomes truly ridiculous: we and our tamed animals now represent 97 percent of the earth’s mammalian biomass.

In contrast, our weaker relationships are often with people who are more distant both geographically and demographically.(B) Their information is more novel. Even though we talk to these people less frequently, we have so many weak ties that they end up being a sizable source of information, especially of information to which we don’t otherwise have access.(C) He found that only a sixth of jobs that came via the network were from strong ties, with the rest coming via medium or weak ties; and with more than a quarter coming via weak ties. Strong ties can be more homophilistic. Our closest friends are often those who are most like us.* demographically: 인구통계학적으로 ** homophilistic: 동족친화적인",

For most of human cultural history, none of those things existed.(A) Sadly, this remains true as the final tribal peoples get overwhelmed by those who value money above humanity. We are living in their end times and, to varying extents, we’re all contributing to those endings. Ultimately our values may even prove self-defeating.(B) They held extensive knowledge, knew deep secrets of their lands and creatures. And they experienced rich and rewarding lives; we know so because when their ways were threatened, they fought to hold on to them, to the death.(C) For hundreds of thousands of years, no human culture had a tool with moving parts. Well into the twentieth century, various human foraging cultures retained tools of stone, wood, and bone.

In their experiment, participants were shown a two minute documentary film and then asked a series of questions about the video. Directly after viewing the videos, participants made few errors in their responses and were correctly able to recall the details. Four days later, they could still remember the details and didn’t allow their memories to be swayed when they were presented with any false information about the film. This changed, however, when participants were shown fake responses about the film made by other participants. Upon seeing the incorrect answers of others, participants were also drawn toward the wrong answers themselves. Even after they found out that the other answers had been fabricated and didn’t have anything to do with the documentary, it was too late. The participants were no longer able to distinguish between truth and fiction.
