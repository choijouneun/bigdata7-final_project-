        "paragraph": "Nothing is trash by nature. Anthropologist Mary Douglas brings back and analyzes the common saying that dirt is “matter out of place.” Dirt is relative, she emphasizes. “Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining­table; food is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave pots and pans in the bedroom, or food all over clothing; similarly, bathroom items in the living room; clothing lying on chairs; outdoor things placed indoors; upstairs things downstairs, and so on.” Sorting the dirty from the clean ― removing the shoes from the table, putting the dirty clothing in the washing machine ― involves systematic ordering and classifying. Eliminating dirt is thus a positive process.",

        "question": "37 In a study, a researcher pretending to be a volunteer surveyed a California neighborhood, asking residents if they would allow a large sign reading ‘‘Drive Carefully’’ to be displayed on their front lawns. (A) The reason that they agreed was this: two weeks earlier, these residents had been asked by another volunteer to make a small commitment to display a tiny sign that read ‘‘Be a Safe Driver’’ in their windows.(B) Since it was such a small and simple request, nearly all of them agreed. The astonishing result was that the initial small commitment deeply influenced their willingness to accept the much larger request two weeks later.(C) To help them understand what it would look like, the volunteer showed his participants a picture of the large sign blocking the view of a beautiful house. Naturally, most people refused, but in one particular group, an incredible 76 percent actually approved. [3점]",

With one group, the discussion was led in a way that built an agreement. With the second group, the discussion was designed to produce disagreements about the right answer. Students who easily reached an agreement were less interested in the topic, studied less, and were less likely to visit the library to get additional information. The most noticeable difference, though, was revealed when teachers showed a special film about the discussion topic — during lunch time! Only 18 percent of the agreement group missed lunch time to see the film, but 45 percent of the students from the disagreement group stayed for the film. The thirst to fill a knowledge gap —to find out who was right within the group — can be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.   According to the experiment above, students’ interest in a topic     (A)     when they are encouraged to     (B)    .
