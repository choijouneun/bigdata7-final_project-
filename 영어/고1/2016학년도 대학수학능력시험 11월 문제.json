Indeed, research suggests that students who are confident about their ability to succeed in school tend to perform better on academic tests than those with less confidence. That said, negative consequences also stem from being too confident in the classroom. Students who are overconfident about their ability to succeed in college end up feeling more disconnected and disillusioned than those with more modest expectations. Overconfidence can also leave students with mistaken impressions that they are fully prepared for tests and no longer need to study. Students who have relatively accurate perceptions regarding their progress in learning tend to use more effective study habits and perform better on tests than do those with more error-prone views of their knowledge.",

Her first novel, The Living Is Easy, published in 1948, received positive responses from critics, but failed to attract a large audience. She wrote her second novel, The Wedding, in 1950, but left it incomplete because she was unable to find a publisher. Jacqueline Onassis took note of the short stories that West had been submitting to the Daily News, the local paper at Martha’s Vineyard. Onassis encouraged West to complete her novel and subsequently served as her editor. Her second novel was published in 1995 and was made into a television movie produced by Oprah Winfrey, airing in 1998. West died on August 16, 1998.",
