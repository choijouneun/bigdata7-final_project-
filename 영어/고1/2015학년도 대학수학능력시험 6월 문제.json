He also has the strongest motivation or urge to learn the language, for if he cannot express himself in his mother tongue, some of his basic needs are likely to remain unfulfilled.

These sharks live in the warm waters of the Eastern Pacific region. They may also be found in sandy bays. Their favorite foods include shrimps and crabs. But they will also eat fish eggs. The leopard shark catches its prey by generating a suction force as it expands its buccal cavity. It will then secure food using its teeth. One of the most interesting features of the leopard sharks is their three-pointed teeth. Like some sharks, female leopard sharks lay eggs and hatch them inside their bodies. They keep their babies for twelve months until live birth occurs. A single birth can produce 33 pups.

        "paragraph": "Around 3,000 B.C., ancient Egyptians developed the cubit system of measurement. (A) Of course, the length of a cubit varied from person to person. So Egypt established a standard cubit, called the Royal Cubit. It was based on the length of the Pharaoh’s forearm. The Royal Cubit was a piece of black granite about 52.3 centimeters long. (B) It was based on the lengths of parts of the arm and hand, rather than the foot. The Egyptian cubit was the length of a forearm from the tip of the elbow to the end of the middle finger. The cubit was subdivided into smaller units of spans, palms, digits, and parts of digits.(C) Although the royal architect kept the Royal Cubit, wooden copies were distributed throughout the land. The cubit sticks must have been very accurate, because the lengths of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza vary by only a few centimeters. * granite: 화강암",

That is, no fixed conclusions about a so-called “national character” should be drawn. There are so many popular proverbs from classical, Biblical, and medieval times current in various cultures that it would be foolish to think of them as showing some imagined national character. Nevertheless, the frequent use of certain proverbs in a particular culture could be used together with other social and cultural indicators to form some common concepts. Thus, if the Germans really do use the proverb, “Morgenstunde hat Gold im Munde” (The morning hour has gold in its mouth) with high frequency, then it does mirror  at least to some degree the German attitude towards getting up early.󰀻Although proverbs can not directly    (A)    national character, the frequent use of certain proverbs is likely to form      (B)      concepts of a nation.(A) (B)",
