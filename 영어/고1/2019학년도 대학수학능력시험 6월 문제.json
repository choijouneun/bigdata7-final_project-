        "paragraph": "For almost all things in life, there can be too much of a good thing. Even the best things in life aren’t so great in excess. This concept has been discussed at least as far back as Aristotle. He argued that being virtuous means finding a balance. For example, people should be brave, but if someone is too brave they become reckless. People should be trusting, but if someone is too trusting they are considered gullible. For each of these traits, it is best to avoid both deficiency and excess. The best way is to live at the “sweet spot” that maximizes well­being. Aristotle’s suggestion is that virtue is the midpoint, where someone is neither too generous nor too stingy, neither too afraid nor recklessly brave.                 * excess: 과잉  ** gullible: 잘 속아 넘어가는",

These rings can tell us how old the tree is, and what the weather was like during each year of the tree’s life. Because trees are sensitive to local climate conditions, such as rain and temperature, they give scientists some information about that area’s local climate in the past. For example, tree rings usually grow wider in warm, wet years and are thinner in years when it is cold and dry. If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all during that time. Very old trees in particular can offer clues about what the climate was like long before measurements were recorded.* stump: 그루터기",

If you’ve picked a good spot for stargazing, you’ll see a sky full of stars, shining and twinkling like thousands of brilliant jewels.(A) It might be easier if you describe patterns of stars.

Chances are, that person will have a hard time knowing exactly which star you’re looking at.(C) When you do that, you’re doing exactly what we all do when we look at the stars. We look for patterns, not just so that we can point something out to someone else, but also because that’s what we humans have always done.",

What’s the difference really between fantasy and expectation  While fantasy involves imagining an idealized future, expectation is actually based on a person’s past experiences. So what did the researchers find  The results revealed that those who had engaged in fantasizing about the desired future did worse in all three conditions.
