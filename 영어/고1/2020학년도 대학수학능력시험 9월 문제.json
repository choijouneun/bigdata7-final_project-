The phone wasn’t even that old; maybe a little over one year  I’m just one example.

Children’s play serves as a training ground for developing physical abilities ― skills like walking, running, and jumping that are necessary for everyday living. Play also allows children to try out and learn social behaviors and to acquire values and personality traits that will be important in adulthood.

Perhaps there is nothing naturally sad about a piece of music in a minor key, or played slowly with low notes.

If this view is correct, we should have difficulty interpreting the emotions expressed in culturally unfamiliar music. Totally opposed to this view is the position that the link between music and emotion is one of resemblance. For example, when we feel sad we move slowly and speak slowly and in a low­pitched voice. Thus when we hear slow, low music, we hear it as sad.
