The good doctor would accept vegetables, eggs, or even a simple “thank you” in payment. One winter afternoon, he went to a house to see a child with a fever. The girl’s family had run out of the firewood they needed to keep their tiny house warm. Dr. Ross grabbed a spare blanket from his car and told the father to bathe his daughter’s forehead with cool water. Then Dr. Ross left to take care of other patients. After setting a broken leg, delivering a baby, and cleaning an infected finger, he returned to the sick child’s house with a load of firewood. He built a fire for the little girl and her family.* deliver: 출산을 돕다",
