They know that if they get you to lose your cool you’ll say something that sounds foolish; you’ll simply get angry and then it will be impossible for you to win the argument. So don’t fall for it.

Moinee fell out of the stars down to Tasmania to die.(A) He took pity on the people, gave them bendable knees and cut off their inconvenient kangaroo tails so they could all sit down at last. Then they lived happily ever after.(B) Then he died. The people hated having kangaroo tails and no knees, and they cried out to the heavens for help. Dromerdeener heard their cry and came down to Tasmania to see what the matter was.(C) Before he died, he wanted to give a last blessing to his final resting place, so he decided to create humans. But he was in such a hurry, knowing he was dying, that he forgot to give them knees; and he absent­mindedly gave them big tails like kangaroos, which meant they couldn’t sit down.",
