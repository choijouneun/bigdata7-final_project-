She lay quite still, listening. The thunder rumbled again, sounding much louder. And then slowly, one by one, as if someone were dropping pennies on the roof, came the raindrops. Garnet held her breath hopefully. The sound paused. “Don’t stop! Please!” she whispered. Then the rain burst strong and loud upon the world. Garnet leaped out of bed and ran to the window.

It’s tempting to tell her that she looks great and she must feel wonderful. It feels good for someone to hear positive comments, and this feedback will often be encouraging. However, if you end the discussion there, then the only feedback your friend is getting is about her progress toward an outcome. Instead, continue the discussion. Ask about what she is doing that has allowed her to be successful. What is she eating  Where is she working out  What are the lifestyle changes she has made  When the conversation focuses on the process of change rather than the outcome, it reinforces the value of creating a sustainable process.",

They avoid challenges.” It’s as if they are afraid to do anything that might make them fail and lose your high appraisal. Kids might also get the message that intelligence or talent is something that people either have or don’t have. This leaves kids feeling helpless when they make mistakes.

Fast fashion items may not cost you much at the cash register, but they come with a serious price: tens of millions of people in developing countries, some just children, work long hours in dangerous conditions to make them, in the kinds of factories often labeled sweatshops. Most garment workers are paid barely enough to survive. Fast fashion also hurts the environment. Garments are manufactured using toxic chemicals and then transported around the globe, making the fashion industry the world’s second­largest polluter, after the oil industry.

Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise can more than halve your risk for respiratory infections and other common winter diseases. But when you feel sick, the story changes. “Exercise is great for prevention, but it can be lousy for therapy,” says David Nieman, the director of the Human Performance Lab. Research shows that moderate exercise has no effect on the duration or severity of the common cold. If you have the flu or other forms of fever­causing systemic infections, exercise can slow recovery and, therefore, is a bad idea. Your immune system is working overtime to fight off the infection, and exercise, a form of physical stress, makes that task harder. * respiratory: 호흡기의** lousy: 나쁜",

Yet the physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so small that its effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem without substantially affecting the answer. Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand.

        "question": "37 Trade will not occur unless both parties want what the other party has to offer. (A) However, if the farmer is enterprising and utilizes his network of village friends, he might discover that the baker is in need of some new cast­iron trivets for cooling his bread, and it just so happens that the blacksmith needs a new lamb’s wool sweater. (B) This is referred to as the double coincidence of wants. Suppose a farmer wants to trade eggs with a baker for a loaf of bread. If the baker has no need or desire for eggs, then the farmer is out of luck and does not get any bread. (C) Upon further investigation, the farmer discovers that the weaver has been wanting an omelet for the past week. The farmer will then trade the eggs for the sweater, the sweater for the trivets, and the trivets for his fresh­baked loaf of bread. * trivet: 삼각 거치대",

        "paragraph": "At the Leipzig Zoo in Germany, 34 zoo chimpanzees and orangutans participating in a study were each individually tested in a room, where they were put in front of two boxes. An experimenter would place an object inside one box and leave the room. Another experimenter would enter the room, move the object into the other box and exit. When the first experimenter returned and tried retrieving the object from the first box, the great ape would help the experimenter open the second box, which it knew the object had been transferred to. However, most apes in the study did not help the first experimenter open the second box if the first experimenter was still in the room to see the second experimenter move the item. The findings show the great apes understood when the first experimenter still thought the item was where he or she last left it. According to the study, great apes can distinguish whether or not people have a(n) (A) belief about reality and use this understanding to (B) people.
