This may be difficult for people who are lonely, but research shows that it can help. Studies reveal that people who are engaged in service to others, such as volunteering, tend to be happier. Volunteers report a sense of satisfaction at enriching their social network in the service of others. Volunteering helps to reduce loneliness in two ways. First, someone who is lonely might benefit from helping others. Also, they might benefit from being involved in a voluntary program where they receive support and help to build their own social network.",

Their collaboration is important because it marries the artist with the scientist.(B) It is often believed that Shakespeare, like most playwrights of his period, did not always write alone, and many of his plays are considered collaborative or were rewritten after their original composition. Leonardo Da Vinci made his sketches individually, but he collaborated with other people to add the finer details.(C) Similarly, Marie Curie’s husband stopped his original research and joined Marie in hers. They went on to collaboratively discover radium, which overturned old ideas in physics and chemistry.* anatomy: 해부학적 구조",
