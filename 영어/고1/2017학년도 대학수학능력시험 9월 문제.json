When we were young and didn’t have the money to go anywhere else, we would walk there almost every day. Now we are seniors, and my wife must use a wheelchair for extended walks. We find that the beautiful walking paths through the park are all but impassable to her. The paths are cracked and littered with rocks and debris that make it impossible to roll her chair from place to place. We hope you will devote resources to restoring the walking paths in Freer Park for all visitors.Sincerely,Craig Thomas＊debris: 파편, 쓰레기",

The actions of others often speak volumes louder than their words. However, when someone exhibits some difficult behavior, you might want to reserve judgement for later. People are not always defined by their behavior. It is common to think, “He is so bossy,” or “She is so mean,” after observing less­than­desirable behavior in someone. But you should never make such assumptions right away. You should give someone a second chance before you label them and shut them out forever. You may find a great co­worker or best friend in someone, so don’t eliminate a person from your life based on a brief observation.",

Every political leader who had an impact on history practiced the discipline of being alone to think and plan. Great artists spend countless hours in their studios or with their instruments not just doing, but exploring their ideas and experiences. Time alone allows people to sort through their experiences, put them into perspective, and plan for the future. I strongly encourage you to find a place to think and to discipline yourself to pause and use it because it has the potential to change your life.

        "paragraph": "The short answer is no, though it may not seem that way to the casual observer. (",
        "choice1": ") That’s because after death, the human body dehydrates, causing the skin to shrink, or become smaller. (",
        "choice2": ") This shrinking exposes the parts of the nails and hair that were once under the skin, causing them to appear longer than before. (",
        "choice3": ") Typically, fingernails grow about 0.1 millimeters a day, but in order to grow, they need glucose — a simple sugar that helps to power the body. (",
        "choice4": ") Once the body dies, there’s no more glucose. (",
        "choice5": ") Moreover, a complex hormonal regulation directs the growth of hair and nails, none of which is possible once a person dies.＊dehydrate: 수분이 빠지다",

Something about these extinct creatures from long ago seems to hold almost everyone’s attention, young or old, boy or girl. Though we don’t know a lot about dinosaurs, what we do know is fascinating to children of all ages. But why? “I think the reason kids like dinosaurs so much is that dinosaurs were big, were different from anything alive today, and are extinct. So they are imagination engines,” explains Jack Horner, a technical advisor for the Jurassic Park films. Teachers all over the country would agree. Dinosaurs are studied in classrooms each year, not only for the science behind the topic, but also because of the thinking it seems to foster in students. “The best part about this is what happens with their writing,” Jennifer Zimmerman, a primary school teacher in Washington, D.C., says. “I think it’s the mystery of dinosaurs ― the fact that there are still so many things we don’t know ― that inspires them to use that topic in their journals.” Children also feel powerful when asked to draw a dinosaur.
