        "question": "37 Natural processes form minerals in many ways. For example, hot melted rock material, called magma, cools when it reaches the Earth’s surface, or even if it’s trapped below the surface. As magma cools, its atoms lose heat energy, move closer together, and begin to combine into compounds.(A) Also, the size of the crystals that form depends partly on how rapidly the magma cools. When magma cools slowly, the crystals that form are generally large enough to see with the unaided eye.(B) During this process, atoms of the different compounds arrange themselves into orderly, repeating patterns. The type and amount of elements present in a magma partly determine which minerals will form.(C) This is because the atoms have enough time to move together and form into larger crystals. When magma cools rapidly, the crystals that form will be small. In such cases, you can’t easily see individual mineral crystals. [3점]* compound: 화합물",
