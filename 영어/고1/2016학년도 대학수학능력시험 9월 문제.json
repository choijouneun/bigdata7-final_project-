Thus, although scientists make many errors, science can be self­correcting. However, in order for the mechanism of peer review to work, it is important that scientists do not avoid this process. Research should be evaluated by other members of the scientific profession before it is applied or made public. There are many studies that contain errors because the researchers did not allow their work to be evaluated by peers before they published it.",

Two and a half years later, he asked them the same question. In that second interview, 25 percent of the students gave completely different accounts of where they were. Half had significant errors in their answers and less than 10 percent remembered with any real accuracy.

Officials hired a team to beautify the city by installing a series of blue lights in various noticeable locations.       In theory, blue lights are more attractive and calming than the yellow and white lights that illuminate much of the city at night, and indeed the blue lights seemed to cast a soothing glow. Months passed and the city’s crime statisticians noticed a striking trend: The locations that were newly bathed in blue experienced a dramatic decline in criminal activity. The blue lights in Glasgow, which mimicked the lights atop police cars, seemed to imply that the police were always watching. The lights were never designed to reduce crime, but that’s exactly what they appeared to be doing.",

Wharton also had a great love of architecture, and she designed and built her first real home. During World War I, she devoted much of her time to assisting orphans from France and Belgium and helped raise funds to support them.
