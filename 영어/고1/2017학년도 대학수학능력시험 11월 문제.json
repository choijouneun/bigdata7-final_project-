        "paragraph": "Sometimes, we are fascinated when our assumptions are turned inside out and around. The artist Pablo Picasso, for example, used Cubism as a way to help us see the world differently. In his famous work Three Musicians, he used abstract forms to shape the players in such an unexpected way that when you first see this artwork, you assume that nothing makes sense. Yet when you look at the painting a second time, the figures come together. Picasso’s work challenges your assumptions about how space and objects are used. His artwork helps you see the world differently and reminds you there are alternative ways of using shape, objects, and colors. The reward for this is the intrinsic pleasure you get by looking at this work.",

        "question": "22 The often-used phrase “pay attention” is insightful: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once. You could not compute the product of 17 × 24 while making a left turn into dense traffic, and you certainly should not try. You can do several things at once, but only if they are easy and undemanding. You are probably safe carrying on a conversation with a passenger while driving on an empty highway, and many parents have discovered, perhaps with some guilt, that they can read a story to a child while thinking of something else.",

They’d already demonstrated their mastery of the deceptive arts by hunting prey with artfully hidden traps or by tricking them into running off cliffs. As the human capacity to speak developed, so did our ability not only to trick prey and deceive predators but to lie to other humans. This too could be advantageous. Those who could persuade members of a rival tribe that a westward-moving herd of caribou had migrated east won a battle in the war for survival. Verbal deceitfulness gave early humans such a survival advantage that some evolutionary biologists believe the capacity to speak and the ability to lie developed hand in hand.* caribou: (북아메리카산) 순록",

Terrified by the poor medical treatment for female patients, she founded a hospital for women in Edinburgh in which the staff consisted only of women. She was also actively engaged in politics and worked for women’s voting rights. The outbreak of the First World War turned her attention to helping the troops, and she organized fourteen medical units to send to battlefields throughout Europe.

Knowing how to breathe when you were born is an implicit memory.(A) Explicit memories, on the other hand, are the memories or the specific things that you consciously try to recall. You use explicit memory every day on a conscious level. (B) No one taught this to you. Some of the things you’ve learned since childhood also become implicit memories. Implicit memories are imprinted in the brain’s autonomic portion; that is why even after years of not riding a bike you still know how to ride.(C) Trying to find the keys, trying to remember when an event is supposed to take place, where it’s going to be held, and with whom you are going. Explicit memories are the tasks you have written down on your calendar or planner.",

        "paragraph": "If you want to modify people’s behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing  According to Peter Salovey, one of the originators of the concept of emotional intelligence, it depends on whether they perceive the new behavior as safe or risky. If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it ― they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. They’re already comfortable with the status quo, so the benefits of change aren’t attractive, and the stop system kicks in. Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and emphasize the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. The prospect of a certain loss brings the go system online.* status quo: 현재 상태The way to modify people’s behavior depends on their (A): if the new behavior is regarded as safe, emphasizing the rewards works but if regarded as risky, highlighting the loss of staying (B) works.(A)(B)",
