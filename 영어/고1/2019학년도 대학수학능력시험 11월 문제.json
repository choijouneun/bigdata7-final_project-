For those contributions, in 1844, he was awarded a gold medal for mathematics by the Royal Society. Boole was deeply interested in expressing the workings of the human mind in symbolic form, and his two books on this subject, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic and An Investigation of the Laws of Thought form the basis of today’s computer science. In 1849, he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen’s College in Cork, Ireland and taught there until his death in 1864.",

Parents are responsible for providing their children with the basic necessities of life ― food, clothing, shelter, and so forth. These expectations are so powerful that not meeting them may make the parents vulnerable to charges of negligence or abuse. Children, in turn, are expected to do as their parents say.

        "choice3": ") This can be done through lighting, costumes, scenery, voice, and movements. (",

        "choice5": ") All these techniques will quickly draw the audience’s attention to the actor whom the director wants to be in focus.",
