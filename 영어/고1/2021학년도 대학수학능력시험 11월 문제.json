Smiling at students ― to let them know that you are glad to see them ― does not require a great deal of time or effort, but it can make a significant difference in the classroom climate right from the start of class.",

        "paragraph": "We used to think that the brain never changed, but according to the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, we now know that this is not true ― specific brain circuits grow stronger through regular practice. He explains, “Well-being is fundamentally no different than learning to play the cello. If one practices the skills of well-being, one will get better at it.” What this means is that you can actually train your brain to become more grateful, relaxed, or confident, by repeating experiences that evoke gratitude, relaxation, or confidence. Your brain is shaped by the thoughts you repeat. The more neurons fire as they are activated by repeated thoughts and activities, the faster they develop into neural pathways, which cause lasting changes in the brain. Or in the words of Donald Hebb, “Neurons that fire together wire together.” This is such an encouraging premise: bottom line ― we can intentionally create the habits for the brain to be happier.* evoke: (감정을) 불러일으키다  ** premise: 전제",

And our work of figuring out a text’s implications tests our analytical powers. In considering what a text suggests, we gain practice in making sense of texts.(B) But whatever the proportion of a work’s showing to telling, there is always something for readers to interpret.

They don’t want “informed guesses,” they want certainties that make their lives easier, and science is often unequipped to meet these demands. In particular, the human body is fantastically complex, and some scientific answers can never be provided in black-or-white terms. All this is why the media tends to oversimplify scientific research when presenting it to the public. In their eyes, they’re just “giving people what they want” as opposed to offering more accurate but complex information that very few people will read or understand. A perfect example of this is how people want definitive answers as to which foods are “good” and “bad.” Scientifically speaking, there are no “good” and “bad” foods; rather, food quality exists on a continuum, meaning that some foods are better than others when it comes to general health and well-being.* continuum: 연속(체)뾞With regard to general health, science, by its nature, does not (A) the public’s demands for certainty, which leads to the media giving less (B) answers to the public.(A)(B)(A)(B)",
