        "paragraph": "Human beings are driven by a natural desire to form and maintain interpersonal relationships. From this perspective, people seek relationships with others to fill a fundamental need, and this need underlies many emotions, actions, and decisions throughout life. Probably, the need to belong is a product of human beings’ evolutionary history as a social species. Human beings have long depended on the cooperation of others for the supply of food, protection from predators, and the acquisition of essential knowledge. Without the formation and maintenance of social bonds, early human beings probably would not have been able to cope with or adapt to their physical environments. Thus, seeking closeness and meaningful relationships has long been vital for human survival.",

        "paragraph": "Mammals tend to be less colorful than other animal groups, but zebras are strikingly dressed in black­and­white. What purpose do such high contrast patterns serve  The colors’ roles aren’t always obvious. The question of what zebras can gain from having stripes has puzzled scientists for more than a century. To try to solve this mystery, wildlife biologist Tim Caro spent more than a decade studying zebras in Tanzania. He ruled out theory after theory ― stripes don’t keep them cool, stripes don’t confuse predators ― before finding an answer. In 2013, he set up fly traps covered in zebra skin and, for comparison, others covered in antelope skin. He saw that flies seemed to avoid landing on the stripes. After more research, he concluded that stripes can literally save zebras from disease­carrying insects.* antelope: 영양(羚羊)",

        "paragraph": "Recent studies point to the importance of warm physical contact for healthy relationships with others. In one study, participants who briefly held a cup of hot (versus iced) coffee judged a target person as having a “warmer” personality (generous, caring); in another study, participants holding a hot (versus cold) pack were more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of something for themselves. These findings illustrate that mere contact experiences of physical warmth activate feelings of interpersonal warmth. Moreover, this temporarily increased activation of interpersonal warmth feelings then influences judgments toward other people in an unintentional manner. Such feelings activated in one context last for a while thereafter and have influence on judgment and behavior in later contexts without the person’s awareness.Experiencing physical warmth (A) interpersonal warmth, which happens in a(n) (B) way.(A)(B)",
