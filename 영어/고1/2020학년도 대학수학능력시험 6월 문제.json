As you read it over, the material is familiar because you remember it from before, and this familiarity might lead you to think, “Okay, I know that.” The problem is that this feeling of familiarity is not necessarily equivalent to knowing the material and may be of no help when you have to come up with an answer on the exam.

(A) It is due, also, to the knowledge that, in an insecure world, pleasure is uncertain. Therefore, the immediate pleasure of eating must be exploited to the full, even though it does violence to the digestion.(B) This is largely due to anxiety, to the knowledge that a constant supply of food is uncertain. Therefore, they eat as much as possible while they can.(C) When animals’ stomachs are full, they stop eating, but humans are never sure when to stop. When they have eaten as much as their bellies can take, they still feel empty, they still feel an urge for further gratification. *gratification: 만족감",

Naturally, your mind recreates what it just “saw” based on what it’s been told. Not surprisingly, you walk on the court and drop the ball.
