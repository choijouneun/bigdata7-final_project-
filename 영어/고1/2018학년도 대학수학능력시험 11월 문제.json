Each day, as school closes, dozens of students come to the library to do homework, use the library’s computers, or socialize in a safe place. Many of these children would otherwise go home to empty houses, and the library is the one place that provides a secure, supervised alternative to being home alone. Your proposed policy of closing libraries on Mondays as a cost cutting measure could be harmful to these children, and I’m certain there are other ways to save money. I urge you and other city council representatives to cancel the plan and to keep libraries open!Sincerely,Kyle Tucker",

So once the additional facts are understood ― that the person was referring to a song and not a real fire ― the context is better understood and you are in a better position to judge and react.

The number 799 feels significantly less than 800 because we see the former as 7-something and the latter as 8-something, whereas 798 feels pretty much like 799. Since the nineteenth century, shopkeepers have taken advantage of this trick by choosing prices ending in a 9, to give the impression that a product is cheaper than it is. Surveys show that around a third to two-thirds of all retail prices now end in a 9. Though we are all experienced shoppers, we are still fooled. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern Brittany monitored a local pizza restaurant that was serving five types of pizza at €8.00 each. When one of the pizzas was reduced in price to €7.99, its share of sales rose from a third of the total to a half.",

His father owned an extensive library where Turner became fascinated with reading about the habits and behavior of insects. Proceeding with his study, Turner earned a doctorate degree in zoology, the first African American to do so. Even after receiving his degree, Turner was unable to get a teaching or research position at any major universities, possibly as a result of racism. He moved to St. Louis and taught biology at Sumner High School, focusing on research there until 1922. Turner was the first person to discover that insects are capable of learning, illustrating that insects can alter behavior based on previous experience. He died of cardiac disease in Chicago in 1923. During his 33-year career, Turner published more than 70 papers. His last scientific paper was published the year after his death. * cardiac: 심장의",

The key feature that distinguishes predator species from prey species isn’t the presence of claws or any other feature related to biological weaponry. The key feature is the position of their eyes.

Prey, on the other hand, often have eyes facing outward, maximizing peripheral vision, which allows the hunted to detect danger that may be approaching from any angle. Consistent with our place at the top of the food chain, humans have eyes that face forward.

        "question": "36 Color can impact how you perceive weight. Dark colors look heavy, and bright colors look less so. Interior designers often paint darker colors below brighter colors to put the viewer at ease.(A) In fact, black is perceived to be twice as heavy as white. Carrying the same product in a black shopping bag, versus a white one, feels heavier. So, small but expensive products like neckties and accessories are often sold in dark-colored shopping bags or cases.(B) In contrast, shelving dark-colored products on top can create the illusion that they might fall over, which can be a source of anxiety for some shoppers. Black and white, which have a brightness of 0% and 100%, respectively, show the most dramatic difference in perceived weight.(C) Product displays work the same way. Place bright-colored products higher and dark-colored products lower, given that they are of similar size. This will look more stable and allow customers to comfortably browse the products from top to bottom.",

        "question": "37 Ethical and moral systems are different for every culture. According to cultural relativism, all of these systems are equally valid, and no system is better than another.(A) There exists an inherent logical inconsistency in cultural relativism, however. If one accepts the idea that there is no right or wrong, then there exists no way to make judgments in the first place. To deal with this inconsistency, cultural relativism creates “tolerance.”(B) The basis of cultural relativism is the notion that no true standards of good and evil actually exist. Therefore, judging whether something is right or wrong is based on individual societies’ beliefs, and any moral or ethical opinions are affected by an individual’s cultural perspective.(C) However, with tolerance comes intolerance, which means that tolerance must imply some sort of ultimate good. Thus, tolerance also goes against the very notion of cultural relativism, and the boundaries of logic make cultural relativism impossible. [3점]* tolerance: 관용",
