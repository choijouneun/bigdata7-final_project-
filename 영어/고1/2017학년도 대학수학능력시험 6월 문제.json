As time passes, however, they get used to what they have and, just like the smell of fresh bread, these wonderful assets disappear from their consciousness.

And this could greatly slow his rate of movement or even cause the dog to fall over as he tries to make a high-speed turn. However, the dog’s tail helps to prevent this.
