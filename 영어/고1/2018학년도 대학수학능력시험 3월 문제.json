According to a report, a high school in Boulder, Colorado, is currently experimenting with a study of presentation of historical material. Storytellers present material in dramatic context to the students, and group discussion follows. Students are encouraged to read further. In contrast, another group of students is involved in traditional research/report techniques. The study indicates that the material presented by the storytellers has much more interest and personal impact than that gained via the traditional method.",
