It takes more words to introduce, express, and adequately elaborate an idea in speech than it takes in writing. Why is this so  While the reader can reread, the listener cannot rehear. Speakers do not come equipped with a replay button. Because listeners are easily distracted, they will miss many pieces of what a speaker says. If they miss the crucial sentence, they may never catch up.

Entrepreneur Lauren Thorp, who owns an e­commerce company, says, “While the customer is ‘always’ right, sometimes you just have to fire a customer.” When Thorp has tried everything to resolve a complaint and realizes that the customer will be dissatisfied no matter what, she returns her attention to the rest of her customers, who she says are “the reason for my success.”",

In particular, if an individual and a group want the same resource, the group will generally prevail, so competition for resources would especially favor a need to belong.

In their ears are headpieces: the voice of ‘Jennifer’, a piece of software, tells them where to go and what to do, controlling the smallest details of their movements. Jennifer breaks down instructions into tiny chunks, to minimise error and maximise productivity ― for example, rather than picking eighteen copies of a book off a shelf, the human worker would be politely instructed to pick five. Then another five. Then yet another five. Then another three. Working in such conditions reduces people to machines made of flesh.

While freshness is now being used as a term in food marketing as part of a return to nature, the demand for year­round supplies of fresh produce such as soft fruit and exotic vegetables has led to the widespread use of hot houses in cold climates and increasing reliance on total quality control ― management by temperature control, use of pesticides and computer/satellite­based logistics.

(A) When your mind and body are less alert than at your “peak” hours, the muse of creativity awakens and is allowed to roam more freely. In other words, when your mental machinery is loose rather than standing at attention, the creativity flows.(B) However, if the task you face demands creativity and novel ideas, it’s best to tackle it at your “worst” time of day! So if you are an early bird, make sure to attack your creative task in the evening, and vice versa for night owls.(C) Some of us are night owls, some early birds, and others in between may feel most active during the afternoon hours. If you are able to organize your day and divide your work, make it a point to deal with tasks that demand attention at your best time of the day. [3점]* roam: (어슬렁어슬렁) 거닐다",

One message emphasized the opportunity to do good: donating would benefit students, faculty, and staff. The other emphasized the opportunity to feel good: donors would enjoy the warm glow of giving. The two messages were equally effective: in both cases, 6.5 percent of the unwilling alumni ended up donating. Then we combined them, because two reasons are better than one. Except they weren’t. When we put the two reasons together, the giving rate dropped below 3 percent. Each reason alone was more than twice as effective as the two combined. The audience was already skeptical. When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them ― and they shielded themselves against it.* alumni: 졸업생  ** skeptical: 회의적인   In the experiment mentioned above, when the two different reasons to donate were given (A), the audience was less likely to be (B) because they could recognize the intention to persuade them.
