        "question": "37 If you had to write a math equation, you probably wouldn’t write, “Twenty­eight plus fourteen equals forty­two.” It would take too long to write and it would be hard to read quickly.(A) For example, the chemical formula for water is H2O. That tells us that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen (“H” and “2”) atoms and one oxygen (“O”) atom.(B) You would write, “28 + 14 = 42.” Chemistry is the same way. Chemists have to write chemical equations all the time, and it would take too long to write and read if they had to spell everything out.(C) So chemists use symbols, just like we do in math. A chemical formula lists all the elements that form each molecule and uses a small number to the bottom right of an element’s symbol to stand for the number of atoms of that element.

In half of the rooms, a cell phone was placed on a nearby table; in the other half, no phone was present. After the conversations had ended, the researchers asked the participants what they thought of each other. Here’s what they learned: when a cell phone was present in the room, the participants reported the quality of their relationship was worse than those who’d talked in a cell phone­free room. The pairs who talked in the rooms with cell phones thought their partners showed less empathy. Think of all the times you’ve sat down to have lunch with a friend and set your phone on the table. You might have felt good about yourself because you didn’t pick it up to check your messages, but your unchecked messages were still hurting your connection with the person sitting across from you.* empathy: 공감The presence of a cell phone (A) the connection between people involved in conversations, even when the phone is being (B).(A)(B)",
