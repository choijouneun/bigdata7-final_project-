        "paragraph": "Consider the seemingly simple question How many senses are there  Around 2,370 years ago, Aristotle wrote that there are five, in both humans and animals — sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. However, according to the philosopher Fiona Macpherson, there are reasons to doubt it. For a start, Aristotle missed a few in humans: the perception of your own body which is different from touch and the sense of balance which has links to both touch and vision. Other animals have senses that are even harder to categorize. Many vertebrates have a different sense system for detecting odors. Some snakes can detect the body heat of their prey. These examples tell us that “senses cannot be clearly divided into a limited number of specific kinds,” Macpherson wrote in The Senses. Instead of trying to push animal senses into Aristotelian buckets, we should study them for what they are.* vertebrate: 척추동물  ** odor: 냄새",

Experts can become insensitive to how hard a task is for the beginner, an effect referred to as the ‘curse of knowledge’. Dr Hinds was able to show that as people acquired the skill, they then began to underestimate the level of difficulty of that skill.

All have junior competitive structures where children play for shorter time periods and often in smaller teams.(B) In a similar way, tennis has adapted the court areas, balls and rackets to make them more appropriate for children under 10. The adaptations are progressive and relate to the age of the child.(C) They found the road to success for young children is unlikely if they play on adult fields, courts or arenas with equipment that is too large, too heavy or too fast for them to handle while trying to compete in adult­style competition. Common sense has prevailed: different sports have made adaptations for children.* prevail: 널리 퍼지다",

The Inca empire could relay messages 1,000 miles (1,610 km) in three or four days under good conditions.(B) The messengers were stationed on the royal roads to deliver the Inca king’s orders and reports coming from his lands. Called Chasquis, they lived in groups of four to six in huts, placed from one to two miles apart along the roads.(C) They were all young men and especially good runners who watched the road in both directions.
