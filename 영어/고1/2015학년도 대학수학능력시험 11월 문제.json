        "question": "21 We have all had the experience of suddenly noticing that a source of constant background noise, such as a distant jackhammer or music from a store, has just ceased ― yet we hadn’t noticed the sound while it was ongoing. Your auditory areas were predicting its continuation, moment after moment, and as long as the noise didn’t change you paid it no attention. By ceasing, it violated your prediction and attracted your attention. Here’s a historical example. Right after New York City stopped running elevated trains, people called the police in the middle of the night claiming that something woke them up. They tended to call around the time the trains used to run past their apartments.",

Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call and recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation.

Color intensity also affects flavor perception. A stronger color may cause perception of a stronger flavor in a product, even if the stronger color is simply due to the addition of more food coloring. Texture also can be misleading.

Researchers measured how fast and how many times dogs would give their paw if they were not rewarded. Once this baseline level of paw giving was established, the researchers had two dogs sit next to each other and asked each dog in turn to give a paw. Then one of the dogs was given a better reward than the other. In response, the dog that was being “paid” less for the same work began giving its paw more reluctantly and stopped giving its paw sooner. This finding raises the very interesting possibility that dogs may have a basic sense of fairness, or at least a hatred of inequality. * paw: 동물의 발󰀻The dog that was rewarded less than the other for the same act showed (A) responses, which suggests that dogs may have a sense of (B).(A)(B)",
