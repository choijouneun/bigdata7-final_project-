By understanding post­purchase behavior, you can understand the influence and the likelihood of whether a buyer will repurchase the product (and whether she will keep it or return it). You’ll also determine whether the buyer will encourage others to purchase the product from you. Satisfied customers can become unpaid ambassadors for your business, so customer satisfaction should be on the top of your to­do list. People tend to believe the opinions of people they know. People trust friends over advertisements any day. They know that advertisements are paid to tell the “good side” and that they’re used to persuade them to purchase products and services. By continually monitoring your customer’s satisfaction after the sale, you have the ability to avoid negative word­of­mouth advertising.",

A 1999 study of 31 countries by American psychologist Robert Levine and Canadian psychologist Ara Norenzayan found that wealthier, more industrialized nations had a faster pace of life — which led to a higher standard of living, but at the same time left the population feeling a constant sense of urgency, as well as being more prone to heart disease.

The discounted soup was sold in one of three conditions: a control, where there was no limit on the volume of purchases, or two tests, where customers were limited to either four or twelve cans. In the unlimited condition shoppers bought 3.3 cans on average, whereas in the scarce condition, when there was a limit, they bought 5.3 on average. This suggests scarcity encourages sales.

Many lived in different places throughout the year, hunting for food or moving their livestock to areas with enough food. (A) For example, priests wanted to know when to carry out religious ceremonies. This was when people first invented clocks ― devices that show, measure, and keep track of passing time.(B) There was no need to tell the time because life depended on natural cycles, such as the changing seasons or sunrise and sunset. Gradually more people started to live in larger settlements, and some needed to tell the time.(C) Clocks have been important ever since. Today, clocks are used for important things such as setting busy airport timetables ― if the time is incorrect, aeroplanes might crash into each other when taking off or landing! [3점]",

        "question": "37 Managers are always looking for ways to increase productivity, which is the ratio of costs to output in production. Adam Smith, writing when the manufacturing industry was new, described a way that production could be made more efficient, known as the “division of labor.”(A) Because each worker specializes in one job, he or she can work much faster without changing from one task to another. Now 10 workers can produce thousands of pins in a day — a huge increase in productivity from the 200 they would have produced before. (B) One worker could do all these tasks, and make 20 pins in a day. But this work can be divided into its separate processes, with a number of workers each performing one task.(C) Making most manufactured goods involves several different processes using different skills. Smith’s example was the manufacture of pins: the wire is straightened, sharpened, a head is put on, and then it is polished.* ratio: 비율",

        "question": "39 As children absorb more evidence from the world around them, certain possibilities become much more likely and more useful and harden into knowledge or beliefs.According to educational psychologist Susan Engel, curiosity begins to decrease as young as four years old.

        "paragraph": "Nearly eight of ten U.S. adults believe there are “good foods” and “bad foods.” Unless we’re talking about spoiled stew, poison mushrooms, or something similar, however, no foods can be labeled as either good or bad. There are, however, combinations of foods that add up to a healthful or unhealthful diet. Consider the case of an adult who eats only foods thought of as “good” ― for example, raw broccoli, apples, orange juice, boiled tofu, and carrots. Although all these foods are nutrient­dense, they do not add up to a healthy diet because they don’t supply a wide enough variety of the nutrients we need. Or take the case of the teenager who occasionally eats fried chicken, but otherwise stays away from fried foods. The occasional fried chicken isn’t going to knock his or her diet off track. But the person who eats fried foods every day, with few vegetables or fruits, and loads up on supersized soft drinks, candy, and chips for snacks has a bad diet.Unlike the common belief, defining foods as good or bad is not (A); in fact, a healthy diet is determined largely by what the diet is (B).(A)(B)",
