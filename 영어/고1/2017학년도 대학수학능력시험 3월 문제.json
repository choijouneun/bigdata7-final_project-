Thus, it is not surprising that constant exposure to noise is related to children’s academic achievement, particularly in its negative effects on reading and learning to read. Some researchers found that, when preschool classrooms were changed to reduce noise levels, the children spoke to each other more often and in more complete sentences, and their performance on prereading tests improved. Research with older children suggests similar findings. On reading and math tests, elementary and high school students in noisy schools or classrooms consistently perform below those in quieter settings.",

People gather where things are happening and seek the presence of other people. Faced with the choice of walking down an empty or a lively street, most people would choose the street with life and activity. The walk will be more interesting and feel safer. Events where we can watch people perform or play music attract many people to stay and watch. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show that the seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people.",

Consumers can collect additional information by conducting online research, reading news articles, talking to friends or consulting an expert. Consumers also reduce uncertainty by buying the same brand that they did the last time, believing that the product should be at least as satisfactory as their last purchase. In addition, some consumers may employ a simple decision rule that results in a safer choice. For example, someone might buy the most expensive offering or choose a heavily advertised brand in the belief that this brand has higher quality than other brands.",
