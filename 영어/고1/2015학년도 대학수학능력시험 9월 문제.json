So I have to inform you that hours of operation at Green County Library will change starting October 8, 2015. Operating hours on Thursdays will return to normal, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m..

It is tolerance that protects the diversity which makes the world so exciting. Tolerance is the idea that all people should be equally accepted and equally treated, regardless of their differences from others. It’s a lot like fairness. Having tolerance means giving every person the same consideration, despite a person’s opinions, background, appearance, or other qualities, and whether or not those things are the same as your own. Tolerance allows the world to flourish. That is why treating other people with tolerance is very important.",

We use clichés like this every day in our speech. These expressions are colorful and often appealing in their economy and ability to convey an image or description of an emotion or situation. Someone may be “cold as ice” or “busy as a bee.” A story may be “too funny for words.” These expressions in speech do little harm. In writing, however, clichés suffer the fate of the familiar becoming boring. Your reader has heard and read these expressions so often that they tend to “bounce off” the reader so swiftly that they lose their appeal. Therefore, if you want your writing to be stronger and more effective, try not to use clichés. Clichés in writing ultimately diminish the strength and effectiveness of your message. * bounce off: ~을 맞고 튕겨나가다",

In fact, many of the most outlandish pieces of science fiction have their basis in scientific facts. Because a great deal of science fiction is rooted in science, it can be used to bring literature out of the English classroom and into the science classroom. Not only does science fiction help students see scientific principles in action, but it also builds their critical thinking and creative skills. As students read a science fiction text, they must connect the text with the scientific principles they have learned. Students can read a science fiction text and a non­fiction text covering similar ideas and compare and contrast the two. Students can also build their creative skills by seeing scientific principles used in a different way, possibly creating science fiction stories of their own or imagining new ways to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned. * outlandish: 이상한, 기이한",

At the age of seventeen, Barton began to work as a schoolteacher in a summer school and later decided to get a degree in education. She went to college in New York and graduated in 1851. She worked at a private school and eventually opened her own school in New Jersey in 1853. After that, she worked for a government office in Washington D.C., where she was fired just because she was a woman. It made her fight for the rights of women to be treated equally in the work place. Throughout the Civil War, Barton nursed wounded soldiers back to health and became known as the “Angel of the Battlefield.” While traveling overseas Barton learned of an organization called the International Red Cross. She wanted to bring the organization to America. It took a lot of effort, but Barton finally founded the American Red Cross in 1881.",

        "paragraph": "(A) When you take your finger away, the raw egg will continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid inside is still moving. The hard­boiled egg will stop instantly.(B) This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the hard­boiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. But the hard­boiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs to stop them spinning. (C) Spin both the eggs! You will find the hard­boiled egg spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will shake!",

        "paragraph": "As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate students watched a film, after which they were asked to describe it as fully as possible to other students. The listeners were actually research assistants, and for half the participants they assumed a positive listening style (smiling and nodding); for the other participants they assumed a negative listening style (frowning and unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive listeners included more of their own opinions about what the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, which in turn encourage the speaker to share more personal insights. Negative body language triggers a threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into the relative “safety” of facts. 󰀻According to a research project, the   (A)    of the information that speakers share depends on the type of    (B)    response that listeners give.
