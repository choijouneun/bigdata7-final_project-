In a rush to meet work, school, family, or household responsibilities, people cut back on their sleep, thinking it won’t be a problem, because all of these other activities seem much more important. But research reveals that a number of vital tasks carried out during sleep help to maintain good health and enable people to function at their best. While you sleep, your brain is hard at work forming the pathways necessary for learning and creating memories and new insights. Without enough sleep, you can’t focus and pay attention or respond quickly. A lack of sleep may even cause mood problems. In addition, growing evidence shows that a continuous lack of sleep increases the risk for developing serious diseases.* vital: 매우 중요한",

But those who are able to distinguish between a range of various emotions “do much, much better at managing the ups and downs of ordinary existence than those who see everything in black and white.” In fact, research shows that the process of labeling emotional experience is related to greater emotion regulation and psychosocial well­being.* nuanced: 미묘한 차이가 있는",

He knew how to make things out of glass. This skill came in handy when he made lenses for his simple microscope. He saw tiny veins with blood flowing through them.

        "question": "37 Robert Schumann once said, “The laws of morals are those of art.” What the great man is saying here is that there is good music and bad music.(A) It’s the same with performances: a bad performance isn’t necessarily the result of incompetence. Some of the worst performances occur when the performers, no matter how accomplished, are thinking more of themselves than of the music they’re playing.(B) The greatest music, even if it’s tragic in nature, takes us to a world higher than ours; somehow the beauty uplifts us. Bad music, on the other hand, degrades us.(C) These doubtful characters aren’t really listening to what the composer is saying — they’re just showing off, hoping that they’ll have a great ‘success’ with the public. The performer’s basic task is to try to understand the meaning of the music, and then to communicate it honestly to others. [3점]* incompetence: 무능 ** degrade: 격하시키다",

This may seem like a funny talent for a plant to have, but it all becomes clear when you realize the effect it has on nearby plants. Manganese can be very harmful to plants, especially at high concentrations. Common blackberry is unaffected by damaging effects of this metal and has evolved two different ways of using manganese to its advantage. First, it redistributes manganese from deeper soil layers to shallow soil layers using its roots as a small pipe. Second, it absorbs manganese as it grows, concentrating the metal in its leaves. When the leaves drop and decay, their concentrated manganese deposits further poison the soil around the plant. For plants that are not immune to the toxic effects of manganese, this is very bad news. Essentially, the common blackberry eliminates competition by poisoning its neighbors with heavy metals.* manganese: 망가니즈(금속 원소)  ** deposit: 축적물The common blackberry has an ability to (A) the amount of manganese in the surrounding upper soil, which makes the nearby soil quite (B) for other plants.(A)(B)",
