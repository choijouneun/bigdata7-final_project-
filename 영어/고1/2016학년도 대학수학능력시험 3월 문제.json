To build a hydroelectric dam, a large area must be flooded behind the dam. Whole communities sometimes have to be moved to another place. Entire forests can be drowned. The water released from the dam can be colder than usual and this can affect the ecosystems in the rivers downstream. It can also wash away riverbanks and destroy life on the river bottoms. The worst effect of dams has been observed on salmon that have to travel upstream to lay their eggs. If blocked by a dam, the salmon life cycle cannot be completed.* hydroelectric: 수력 발전의  ** ecosystem: 생태계",
