Dear City Council Members, My name is Celina Evans and I am a lifelong Woodridge resident. The Woodridge Children’s Theater has been the pride of our community since 1975. My daughter Katie has been participating in the theater’s activities for six years. The theater has meant so much to so many in our community. However, I have been made aware that you are considering cutting the budget of the theater. The experiences and life lessons children gain at the theater are invaluable. Not only do kids learn about the arts there, but they also learn skills that will last for a lifetime. To reduce funding would be a huge loss to future generations and thus I strongly object to it. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Sincerely, Celina Evans ①지역 어린이 극장 이용료 인하를 건의하려고 ②지역 문화 시설 이용 시간 연장을 제안하려고 ③지역 어린이 극장 설립을 위한 기부를 요청하려고 ④지역 어린이 극장에 대한 예산 삭감을 반대하려고 ⑤지역 주민들을 위한 문화 공간 부족에 대해 항의하려고 19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? The day for my teaching evaluation arrived. The principal was present to grade my teaching. My heart pounded heavily. I said a little prayer quietly before stepping into the classroom. As I entered the classroom, the tense atmosphere turned into wild laughter. I stood at the front of the classroom wearing my funny dress instead of my formal work clothes, which helped me to get the students’ attention. I took a deep breath and started the language activity with a catchy song that students love. Soon, the magic took off and all the students were blown away. When the class ended, all the students and even the principal started clapping. The class was a success! All my time and effort had finally paid off. ①excited → confused ②jealous → relaxed ③nervous → satisfied ④hopeful → terrified ⑤regretful → delighted 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? More often than not, modern parents are paralyzed by the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their children if they scold them for any reason. They want their children’s friendship above all, and are willing to sacrifice respect to get it. This is not good. A child will have many friends, but only two parents ― if that ― and parents are more, not less, than friends. Friends have very limited authority to correct. Every parent therefore needs to learn to tolerate the momentary anger or even hatred directed toward them by their children, after necessary corrective action has been taken, as the capacity of children to perceive or care about long-term consequences is very limited. Parents are the judges of society. They teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to interact meaningfully and productively with them. ①부모는 두려워 말고 자녀의 잘못된 행동을 바로잡아 주어야 한다. ②부모는 자녀의 신뢰를 얻기 위해 일관된 태도로 양육해야 한다. ③부모는 다양한 경험을 제공하여 자녀의 사회화를 도와야 한다. ④부모는 자녀의 친구 관계에 지나치게 개입하지 말아야 한다. ⑤부모는 자녀와 유대감을 쌓으며 친구의 역할을 해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 the mind’s eye is blind가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? All any neuron in the brain ever “sees” is that some change occurred in the firing patterns of its upstream peers. It cannot tell whether such change is caused by an external disturbance or by the brain’s constant self-organized activity. Thus, neurons located in networks of other neurons do not “know” what the brain’s sensors are sensing; they simply respond to their upstream inputs. In other words, the neurons have no way of relating or comparing their spikes to anything else because they only receive retinal correspondences or processed “representations” of the sensory input. But establishing correspondences without knowing the rules by which those correspondences are constructed is like comparing Mansi words with Khanty words when we understand neither language. Only after we have defined the vocabulary of one language can we understand the corresponding meaning of words in the other. Similarly, without further information, sensory neurons can attach no meaning whatsoever to their spikes. Put simply, the mind’s eye is blind. * spike: 전기 신호 ** retinal: 망막의 ①The brain sees only by linking imagination and experience. ②Neurons respond to sensory input without understanding it. ③Signals carried by neurons cannot be explained in experiments. ④The brain stops imagining scenes and starts storing visual data. ⑤Some visual inputs do not always need the brain for their processing. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? The way reduced prices are written during a sale will greatly affect people’s attitude toward the products (and their likelihood of purchasing them). If the sale prices are easy to understand using percentages (for example, “-50%”) or with the new prices already calculated (for example, “now only $20”), shoppers will react in an automatic and positive fashion. However, if it is necessary for them to do complex mental calculations (for example, if a $27.50 product is advertised at 12% off), they will switch to a more analytical style of thinking. This results in more attention spent on the calculation, and subsequently on the merits of the product. No longer feeling spontaneous, shoppers will start questioning whether it is actually a good deal or not, whether they really need another pair of shoes, etc. The more cognitive effort is demanded from shoppers, the more of a negative and suspicious reaction will be evoked, and the chances of making a sale diminish. ①상품 할인율이 클수록 상품의 단점이 쉽게 노출될 수 있다. ②경쟁 상품과 비교되는 품질 정보 제시는 판매에 효과적이다. ③상품에 대한 공인된 평가가 소비에 대한 심리적 장벽을 낮춘다. ④상품 판매율을 높이기 위해 다양한 소비 성향 분석이 필요하다. ⑤상품 할인가 제시 방식의 인지적 부담 정도가 판매에 영향을 준다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Early astronomers saw and learned more from eclipses and other forms of shadow than from direct observation. In Galileo’s time, the empiricist’s insistence on direct observation as the only legitimate way of knowing limited what could be learned about the cosmos, and the medievalist allowance for extraperceptual insights had nothing to contribute to what we would consider scientific inquiry. Galileo’s breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos. * Ptolemaic system: 천동설 ①difficulties in observing and tracking shadows ②lack of various devices used to observe the universe ③consistency in human aspiration toward space exploration ④ways to record planetary movements with early technology ⑤importance of shadow in making new discoveries in astronomy 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Moral philosophy textbooks often proclaim that we can discern if a claim is ethical by attending to the use of the words “is” and “ought.” On this suggestion, the claim “You ought to keep your promises,” because it uses “ought,” is ethical. “An atom is small,” because it uses “is,” is nonethical. Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not. For example, consider the claims “Murder is wrong” and “Friendship is good.” These claims obviously have ethical content. Whatever the is-ought test is tracking, these claims clearly fall on the ought side of that divide. Yet they both use “is.” Similarly, consider the claim “The train ought to arrive in an hour.” This statement is clearly nonethical, the use of “ought” notwithstanding. There is an important distinction between ethical and nonethical claims. But we can’t simply rely on “is” and “ought” to make it. Instead we need to attend to the substance of the claim. * invoke: 예로서 인용하다 ①Mutually Exclusive Relationship Between “Is” and “Ought” ②Sounds Unethical to You?

Donald Griffin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Donald Griffin was an American biophysicist and animal behaviourist known for his research in animal navigation, acoustic orientation, and sensory biophysics. During his childhood, he was influenced by his uncle, who was a Harvard professor of biology. Griffin received a Ph.D. in zoology from Harvard University in 1942. He demonstrated that bats emit high-frequency sounds with which they can locate objects as small as flying insects. In 1965, he became a professor at Rockefeller University in New York and a research zoologist for the New York Zoological Society. After he retired from Rockefeller University in 1986, he didn’t stop his research: he continued to present papers at national and international meetings. In the late 1970s Griffin argued that animals might possess the ability to think and reason. Although his claim sparked much controversy in the science community, there is no question that he radically opened up the field of animal cognition. ①미국의 생물 물리학자이자 동물 행동학자이다. ②어렸을 때 수학 교수인 삼촌에게 영향을 받았다. ③박쥐가 고주파음으로 사물의 위치를 파악함을 증명했다. ④Rockefeller University 퇴직 후 연구를 멈추지 않았다. ⑤동물이 생각하고 추론하는 능력을 지녔을 수 있다고 주장했다. 27.

Ultimately, though, the ①advantages of using woven fabric for clothing would have become obvious.

Dear City Council Members, My name is Celina Evans and I am a lifelong Woodridge resident. The Woodridge Children’s Theater has been the pride of our community since 1975. My daughter Katie has been participating in the theater’s activities for six years. The theater has meant so much to so many in our community. However, I have been made aware that you are considering cutting the budget of the theater. The experiences and life lessons children gain at the theater are invaluable. Not only do kids learn about the arts there, but they also learn skills that will last for a lifetime. To reduce funding would be a huge loss to future generations and thus I strongly object to it. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

The day for my teaching evaluation arrived. The principal was present to grade my teaching. My heart pounded heavily. I said a little prayer quietly before stepping into the classroom. As I entered the classroom, the tense atmosphere turned into wild laughter. I stood at the front of the classroom wearing my funny dress instead of my formal work clothes, which helped me to get the students’ attention. I took a deep breath and started the language activity with a catchy song that students love. Soon, the magic took off and all the students were blown away. When the class ended, all the students and even the principal started clapping. The class was a success!

More often than not, modern parents are paralyzed by the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their children if they scold them for any reason. They want their children’s friendship above all, and are willing to sacrifice respect to get it. This is not good. A child will have many friends, but only two parents ― if that ― and parents are more, not less, than friends. Friends have very limited authority to correct. Every parent therefore needs to learn to tolerate the momentary anger or even hatred directed toward them by their children, after necessary corrective action has been taken, as the capacity of children to perceive or care about long-term consequences is very limited. Parents are the judges of society. They teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to interact meaningfully and productively with them. ①부모는 두려워 말고 자녀의 잘못된 행동을 바로잡아 주어야 한다. ②부모는 자녀의 신뢰를 얻기 위해 일관된 태도로 양육해야 한다. ③부모는 다양한 경험을 제공하여 자녀의 사회화를 도와야 한다. ④부모는 자녀의 친구 관계에 지나치게 개입하지 말아야 한다. ⑤부모는 자녀와 유대감을 쌓으며 친구의 역할을 해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 the mind’s eye is blind가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? All any neuron in the brain ever “sees” is that some change occurred in the firing patterns of its upstream peers. It cannot tell whether such change is caused by an external disturbance or by the brain’s constant self-organized activity. Thus, neurons located in networks of other neurons do not “know” what the brain’s sensors are sensing; they simply respond to their upstream inputs. In other words, the neurons have no way of relating or comparing their spikes to anything else because they only receive retinal correspondences or processed “representations” of the sensory input. But establishing correspondences without knowing the rules by which those correspondences are constructed is like comparing Mansi words with Khanty words when we understand neither language. Only after we have defined the vocabulary of one language can we understand the corresponding meaning of words in the other. Similarly, without further information, sensory neurons can attach no meaning whatsoever to their spikes. Put simply, the mind’s eye is blind. * spike: 전기 신호 ** retinal: 망막의 ①The brain sees only by linking imagination and experience. ②Neurons respond to sensory input without understanding it. ③Signals carried by neurons cannot be explained in experiments. ④The brain stops imagining scenes and starts storing visual data. ⑤Some visual inputs do not always need the brain for their processing. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? The way reduced prices are written during a sale will greatly affect people’s attitude toward the products (and their likelihood of purchasing them). If the sale prices are easy to understand using percentages (for example, “-50%”) or with the new prices already calculated (for example, “now only $20”), shoppers will react in an automatic and positive fashion. However, if it is necessary for them to do complex mental calculations (for example, if a $27.50 product is advertised at 12% off), they will switch to a more analytical style of thinking. This results in more attention spent on the calculation, and subsequently on the merits of the product. No longer feeling spontaneous, shoppers will start questioning whether it is actually a good deal or not, whether they really need another pair of shoes, etc. The more cognitive effort is demanded from shoppers, the more of a negative and suspicious reaction will be evoked, and the chances of making a sale diminish. ①상품 할인율이 클수록 상품의 단점이 쉽게 노출될 수 있다. ②경쟁 상품과 비교되는 품질 정보 제시는 판매에 효과적이다. ③상품에 대한 공인된 평가가 소비에 대한 심리적 장벽을 낮춘다. ④상품 판매율을 높이기 위해 다양한 소비 성향 분석이 필요하다. ⑤상품 할인가 제시 방식의 인지적 부담 정도가 판매에 영향을 준다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Early astronomers saw and learned more from eclipses and other forms of shadow than from direct observation. In Galileo’s time, the empiricist’s insistence on direct observation as the only legitimate way of knowing limited what could be learned about the cosmos, and the medievalist allowance for extraperceptual insights had nothing to contribute to what we would consider scientific inquiry. Galileo’s breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos. * Ptolemaic system: 천동설 ①difficulties in observing and tracking shadows ②lack of various devices used to observe the universe ③consistency in human aspiration toward space exploration ④ways to record planetary movements with early technology ⑤importance of shadow in making new discoveries in astronomy 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?

It cannot tell whether such change is caused by an external disturbance or by the brain’s constant self-organized activity. Thus, neurons located in networks of other neurons do not “know” what the brain’s sensors are sensing; they simply respond to their upstream inputs. In other words, the neurons have no way of relating or comparing their spikes to anything else because they only receive retinal correspondences or processed “representations” of the sensory input. But establishing correspondences without knowing the rules by which those correspondences are constructed is like comparing Mansi words with Khanty words when we understand neither language. Only after we have defined the vocabulary of one language can we understand the corresponding meaning of words in the other. Similarly, without further information, sensory neurons can attach no meaning whatsoever to their spikes. Put simply, the mind’s eye is blind.* spike: 전기 신호  ** retinal: 망막의①The brain sees only by linking imagination and experience.②Neurons respond to sensory input without understanding it.③Signals carried by neurons cannot be explained in experiments.④The brain stops imagining scenes and starts storing visual data.⑤Some visual inputs do not always need the brain for their processing."

If the sale prices are easy to understand using percentages (for example, “-50%”) or with the new prices already calculated (for example, “now only $20”), shoppers will react in an automatic and positive fashion. However, if it is necessary for them to do complex mental calculations (for example, if a $27.50 product is advertised at 12% off), they will switch to a more analytical style of thinking. This results in more attention spent on the calculation, and subsequently on the merits of the product. No longer feeling spontaneous, shoppers will start questioning whether it is actually a good deal or not, whether they really need another pair of shoes, etc. The more cognitive effort is demanded from shoppers, the more of a negative and suspicious reaction will be evoked, and the chances of making a sale diminish.①상품 할인율이 클수록 상품의 단점이 쉽게 노출될 수 있다.②경쟁 상품과 비교되는 품질 정보 제시는 판매에 효과적이다.③상품에 대한 공인된 평가가 소비에 대한 심리적 장벽을 낮춘다.④상품 판매율을 높이기 위해 다양한 소비 성향 분석이 필요하다.⑤상품 할인가 제시 방식의 인지적 부담 정도가 판매에 영향을 준다."

In Galileo’s time, the empiricist’s insistence on direct observation as the only legitimate way of knowing limited what could be learned about the cosmos, and the medievalist allowance for extraperceptual insights had nothing to contribute to what we would consider scientific inquiry. Galileo’s breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos.* Ptolemaic system: 천동설①difficulties in observing and tracking shadows②lack of various devices used to observe the universe③consistency in human aspiration toward space exploration④ways to record planetary movements with early technology⑤importance of shadow in making new discoveries in astronomy"

Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not. For example, consider the claims “Murder is wrong” and “Friendship is good.” These claims obviously have ethical content. Whatever the is-ought test is tracking, these claims clearly fall on the ought side of that divide. Yet they both use “is.” Similarly, consider the claim “The train ought to arrive in an hour.” This statement is clearly nonethical, the use of “ought” notwithstanding. There is an important distinction between ethical and nonethical claims. But we can’t simply rely on “is” and “ought” to make it. Instead we need to attend to the substance of the claim.* invoke: 예로서 인용하다①Mutually Exclusive Relationship Between “Is” and “Ought”②Sounds Unethical to You?

The urban environment is generally designed so as not to make contact with our skin. We do not push through bushes on our way to school or work. Roads and sidewalks are kept clear of obstacles. Only once in a while are we reminded of the materiality of the environment, as when we feel the brush of an unexpected tree branch or nearly fall over a curb. Most of our time is not even spent outside. “Outside” is often just a space we go through to get “inside.” Our time is largely spent indoors, where architecture and design collude to provide an environment as lacking as possible in tactile stimulation. In the modern university or office building, floors and walls are flat and smooth, corridors are clear, the air is still, the temperature is neutral, and elevators carry one effortlessly from one level to another. It is commonly assumed that we are best served by our tactile environment when . * collude: 결탁하다 ①we accept its harsh elements ②we scarcely notice its presence ③it does not hinder social interactions ④we experience it using all the senses ⑤its design reflects the natural environment 6 영어 영역 6 8 33. The ideal sound quality varies a lot in step with technological and cultural changes. Consider, for instance, the development of new digital audio formats such as MP3 and AAC. Various media feed us daily with data-compressed audio, and some people rarely experience CD-quality (that is, technical quality) audio. This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis. Berger tested first-year university students’ preferences for MP3s annually for ten years. He reports that each year more and more students come to prefer MP3s to CD-quality audio. These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners’ expectations do not necessarily follow the same path. As a result, “improved” technical digital sound quality may in some cases lead to a(n) 점 . * 압축하다 compress: ①decrease in the perceptual worth of the sound ②failure to understand the original function of music ③realization of more sophisticated musical inspiration ④agreement on ideal sound quality across generations ⑤revival of listeners’ preference for CD-quality audio 34. Science shows that like gear teeth in a bicycle chain. Rich and novel experiences, like the recollections of the summers of our youth, have lots of new information associated with them. During those hot days, we learned how to swim or traveled to new places or mastered riding a bike without training wheels. The days went by slowly with those adventures. Yet, our adult lives have less novelty and newness, and are full of repeated tasks such as commuting or sending email or doing paperwork. The associated information filed for those chores is smaller, and there is less new footage for the recall part of the brain to draw upon. Our brain interprets these days filled with boring events as shorter, so summers swiftly speed by. Despite our desire for better clocks, our measuring stick of time isn’t fixed. We don’t measure time with seconds, like our clocks, but by our 점 experiences. For us, time can slow down or time can fly. * 장면 footage: ①the memory functions of our brain wear out with age ②the richness of experiences relies on intellectual capacity ③the information storage system in our mind runs restlessly ④the temporal context of an event pulls our emotions awake ⑤the size of a memory and our perception of time are coupled 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는문장은 ? Research has shown that individuals — especially those who have benefited from a particular system — are prone to support and rationalize the status quo, even if there are clear problems. ①These people justify systemic inequity with familiar phrases like “If you just work hard enough you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps.” ②A branch of psychology called system justification theory describes how people tend to see social, economic, and political systems as good, fair, and legitimate if they have succeeded as a result of those systems. ③According to Erin Godfrey, a professor of applied psychology at New York University, “The people who are at the top want to believe in meritocracy because it means that they deserve their successes.” ④Indeed, it is not surprising that there exists a general consensus across social class about the definition and the results of meritocracy. ⑤Those who are in an advantaged position in society are more likely to believe the system is fair and see no reason to change it. * 현재 상태 status quo: ** 능력주의 meritocracy:",

The ideal sound quality varies a lot in step with technological and cultural changes. Consider, for instance, the development of new digital audio formats such as MP3 and AAC. Various media feed us daily with data-compressed audio, and some people rarely experience CD-quality (that is, technical quality) audio. This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis. Berger tested first-year university students’ preferences for MP3s annually for ten years. He reports that each year more and more students come to prefer MP3s to CD-quality audio. These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners’ expectations do not necessarily follow the same path.

The tasty treat is bitten off and the seed itself is discarded. (B) Ants are motivated by their desire to eat them, and their interest is triggered when forget-me-nots form their seeds. The seeds are designed to make an ant’s mouth water, for attached to the outside is a structure called an elaiosome, which looks like a tiny bit of cake. (C) Along come the trash collectors in the form of worker ants, which dispose of the seeds in the neighborhood ― carrying them up to 200 feet away from home base. Wild strawberries and other plants also benefit from this distribution service: ants are nature’s gardeners, as it were. * 물망초 forget-me-not: (A) ① - (C) - (B) (B) ② - (A) - (C) (B) ③ - (C) - (A) (C) ④ - (A) - (B) (C) ⑤ - (B) - (A) 7 영어 영역 7 8 37. Birds use many techniques to save energy when they are flying, most of which are tricks to stay aloft without flapping. (A) When it reaches the top, the bird bends its wings and glides in the direction it wants to travel, searching for the next thermal. All soaring birds take advantage of thermals, but some species, like the Broad-winged Hawk, are specialists and in the right conditions can travel hundreds of miles with almost no flapping. (B) Riding updrafts to gain altitude is one of the most conspicuous. Bare ground such as fields or parking lots absorbs more heat from the sun, and as air near the ground warms up it rises. (C) This creates a column of rising warm air ― a thermal ― reaching hundreds or even thousands of feet high. A soaring bird can sense the air movement and fly in circles to stay in the column. It simply fans its wings and tail and 점 lets the rising air carry it up like an elevator. * 높이 aloft: ** 상승 온난 기류 thermal: *** 뚜렷한 conspicuous: (A) ① - (C) - (B) (B) ② - (A) - (C) (B) ③ - (C) - (A) (C) ④ - (A) - (B) (C) ⑤ - (B) - (A)",
