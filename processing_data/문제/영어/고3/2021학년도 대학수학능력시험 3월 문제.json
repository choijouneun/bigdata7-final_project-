I was waiting outside when the exam grades were posted on the bulletin board. I was perspiring. My heart started beating fast. What if I failed? A swarm of students rushed forward to see the exam results. Fortunately, I was tall enough to see over their heads. The minute I saw the results, all my anxiety disappeared. I walked quickly back to my dormitory and phoned my father. “Dad,” I mumbled in a haze. “You won’t believe this, but I passed the exams.” My father was speechless. Finally he said, “Son, that is good news. I frankly never thought you’d do it.” I was overjoyed as if I were walking on the cloud. ① anticipating → disappointed ② worried → delighted ③ surprised → calm ④ curious → envious ⑤ bored → excited 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Good teachers know that learning occurs when students compare what they already know with the new ideas presented by the teacher or textbook. It is the students who decide whether or not to reconstruct their conceptions; therefore, teaching should be student centered rather than teacher centered. This means that students should be actively involved in making and interpreting analogies. If we believe that analogy use is an effective way to help students think and learn, then it makes sense to help students generate their own analogies or reconstruct the teacher’s analogies to fit in with their own experiences. ① 학습 내용은 학생 수준에 맞는 난이도로 구성되어야 한다. ② 다양한 사례를 활용하여 학생의 이해를 도와야 한다. ③ 교사는 수업 중 학생과 상호 작용을 많이 해야 한다. ④ 교육 활동에서 이론보다 실습의 비중을 더 높여야 한다. ⑤ 유추를 해내고 재구성하는 과정이 학생 중심이어야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 last in, first out이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? While user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to generate them, their existence inherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo. The fact is, successfully changing long­term user habits is exceptionally rare. Altering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act but also necessitates getting them to repeat behaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives. Companies that succeed in building a habit­forming business are often associated with game­changing, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not. For one, new behaviors have a short half­life, as our minds tend to return to our old ways of thinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to their first learned behaviors over time. To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO ─“last in, first out.” * boon: 요긴한 것 ** regress: 되돌아가다 ① The behavior witnessed first is forgotten first. ② Almost any behavior tends to change over time. ③ After an old habit breaks, a new one is formed. ④ The habit formed last is the hardest to get rid of. ⑤ The habit most recently acquired disappears soonest. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Despite numerous studies on the influence of mediated agendas on politics, most studies examine text only ⎯as if media only deliver words. These studies looked at how reporters, analysts, and commentators verbally describe and criticize the candidates. But they often neglect another important source of influence: visuals. As some communication scholars said, “Stories are often complex combinations of visual and verbal content ⎯all too often the visual information is so powerful that it overwhelms the verbal.” The challenge of tackling visuals to examine their influence is multifaceted. The difficulties of gathering and coding visual data and of attributing impact to specific parts of images have no doubt caused veritable scholars to shy away. But the potential impact of visuals on people’s perceptions is simply too important to ignore. Furthermore, the importance of understanding both visuals and text in tandem cannot be understated. * veritable: 진정한 ** in tandem: 동시에 ① 시각 자료는 정치 관련 보도 자료 연구의 중요한 대상이다. ② 전문가들의 의견도 철저하게 검증하고 보도할 필요가 있다. ③ 다양한 관심사를 반영하는 뉴스 프로그램 편성이 요구된다. ④ 지나치게 방대한 시각 자료는 보도 내용 이해에 방해가 된다. ⑤ 언론인은 보도에서 자신의 정치적 편향을 드러내서는 안 된다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Despite excellent training, actors inevitably experience the visceral life of their characters, even if it is for brief moments during a performance. Self­perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character’s personality with the actor’s personality. Audience attribution errors may increase distress in the actor, including fearing that their personality identity is not stable. * visceral: 마음속에서 느끼는 ** dissociative: 분리적인 ①criteria for evaluating an actor’s performance ②difficulties in portraying complicated characters ③background knowledge for appreciating the play ④confusion of identity between actor and character ⑤psychological barriers between actors and the audience 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? There is a story about F. Yates, a prominent UK statistician. During his student years at St. John’s College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John’s College has a massive neo­Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled. * decorous: 품위 있는 ** surplice: 흰 가운 *** divest: 벗기다 ① A Scary Legend About the Statues at St. John’s College ② A Student Who Solved a Problem of His Own Making ③ Standards of Beauty Varying from Person to Person ④ A Smart Professor Who Identified a Criminal ⑤ A Success Story of a Mysterious Architect 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the top five composers ranked by the number of performances in concerts worldwide from 2015 to 2017. ①In 2015 and 2017, Mozart was the most performed composer, with more than 3,000 performances each year. ②For all three years, the least performed composer was Schubert, whose music was performed less than 2,000 times each year. ③The three composers whose rankings in the number of performances remained the same throughout the whole period were Beethoven, Brahms, and Schubert. ④As for the two composers, Bach and Schubert, the number of performances steadily increased from 2015 to 2017. ⑤The gap in the number of performances between Beethoven and Bach was the largest in 2016 and the smallest in 2017. 26. Herbert Shelton에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Herbert Shelton was born on October 6, 1895 in Wylie, Texas. As a child, Shelton took an interest in animals, especially their habits when sick as compared to when well. Shelton attended Bernarr Macfadden’s College of Physcultopathy in Chicago and interned at Crane’s Sanatorium in Elmhurst, Illinois. In 1921, he graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton’s work served as an early influence for the raw food movement. A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti­draft statement in public during the height of World War I. By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from Parkinson’s disease. He died thirteen years later. * anti­draft: 징병 반대의 ① 병에 걸린 동물의 습성에 관심을 가졌다. ② Crane’s Sanatorium에서 인턴으로 일했다. ③ 의학적 치료보다 단식을 옹호했다. ④ 1917년에 투옥되었다. ⑤ 파킨슨병을 앓다가 77세에 사망했다. 27.

I was waiting outside when the exam grades were posted on the bulletin board. I was perspiring. My heart started beating fast. What if I failed? A swarm of students rushed forward to see the exam results. Fortunately, I was tall enough to see over their heads. The minute I saw the results, all my anxiety disappeared. I walked quickly back to my dormitory and phoned my father. “Dad,” I mumbled in a haze. “You won’t believe this, but I passed the exams.” My father was speechless. Finally he said, “Son, that is good news. I frankly never thought you’d do it.” I was overjoyed as if I were walking on the cloud. ① anticipating → disappointed ② worried → delighted ③ surprised → calm ④ curious → envious ⑤ bored → excited 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Good teachers know that learning occurs when students compare what they already know with the new ideas presented by the teacher or textbook. It is the students who decide whether or not to reconstruct their conceptions; therefore, teaching should be student centered rather than teacher centered. This means that students should be actively involved in making and interpreting analogies. If we believe that analogy use is an effective way to help students think and learn, then it makes sense to help students generate their own analogies or reconstruct the teacher’s analogies to fit in with their own experiences. ① 학습 내용은 학생 수준에 맞는 난이도로 구성되어야 한다. ② 다양한 사례를 활용하여 학생의 이해를 도와야 한다. ③ 교사는 수업 중 학생과 상호 작용을 많이 해야 한다. ④ 교육 활동에서 이론보다 실습의 비중을 더 높여야 한다. ⑤ 유추를 해내고 재구성하는 과정이 학생 중심이어야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 last in, first out이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? While user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to generate them, their existence inherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo. The fact is, successfully changing long­term user habits is exceptionally rare. Altering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act but also necessitates getting them to repeat behaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives. Companies that succeed in building a habit­forming business are often associated with game­changing, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not. For one, new behaviors have a short half­life, as our minds tend to return to our old ways of thinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to their first learned behaviors over time. To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO ─“last in, first out.” * boon: 요긴한 것 ** regress: 되돌아가다 ① The behavior witnessed first is forgotten first. ② Almost any behavior tends to change over time. ③ After an old habit breaks, a new one is formed. ④ The habit formed last is the hardest to get rid of. ⑤ The habit most recently acquired disappears soonest. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Despite numerous studies on the influence of mediated agendas on politics, most studies examine text only ⎯as if media only deliver words. These studies looked at how reporters, analysts, and commentators verbally describe and criticize the candidates. But they often neglect another important source of influence: visuals. As some communication scholars said, “Stories are often complex combinations of visual and verbal content ⎯all too often the visual information is so powerful that it overwhelms the verbal.” The challenge of tackling visuals to examine their influence is multifaceted. The difficulties of gathering and coding visual data and of attributing impact to specific parts of images have no doubt caused veritable scholars to shy away. But the potential impact of visuals on people’s perceptions is simply too important to ignore. Furthermore, the importance of understanding both visuals and text in tandem cannot be understated. * veritable: 진정한 ** in tandem: 동시에 ① 시각 자료는 정치 관련 보도 자료 연구의 중요한 대상이다. ② 전문가들의 의견도 철저하게 검증하고 보도할 필요가 있다. ③ 다양한 관심사를 반영하는 뉴스 프로그램 편성이 요구된다. ④ 지나치게 방대한 시각 자료는 보도 내용 이해에 방해가 된다. ⑤ 언론인은 보도에서 자신의 정치적 편향을 드러내서는 안 된다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Despite excellent training, actors inevitably experience the visceral life of their characters, even if it is for brief moments during a performance. Self­perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character’s personality with the actor’s personality. Audience attribution errors may increase distress in the actor, including fearing that their personality identity is not stable. * visceral: 마음속에서 느끼는 ** dissociative: 분리적인 ①criteria for evaluating an actor’s performance ②difficulties in portraying complicated characters ③background knowledge for appreciating the play ④confusion of identity between actor and character ⑤psychological barriers between actors and the audience 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? There is a story about F. Yates, a prominent UK statistician. During his student years at St. John’s College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John’s College has a massive neo­Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled. * decorous: 품위 있는 ** surplice: 흰 가운 *** divest: 벗기다 ① A Scary Legend About the Statues at St. John’s College ② A Student Who Solved a Problem of His Own Making ③ Standards of Beauty Varying from Person to Person ④ A Smart Professor Who Identified a Criminal ⑤ A Success Story of a Mysterious Architect 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the top five composers ranked by the number of performances in concerts worldwide from 2015 to 2017. ①In 2015 and 2017, Mozart was the most performed composer, with more than 3,000 performances each year. ②For all three years, the least performed composer was Schubert, whose music was performed less than 2,000 times each year. ③The three composers whose rankings in the number of performances remained the same throughout the whole period were Beethoven, Brahms, and Schubert. ④As for the two composers, Bach and Schubert, the number of performances steadily increased from 2015 to 2017. ⑤The gap in the number of performances between Beethoven and Bach was the largest in 2016 and the smallest in 2017. 26.

Furthermore, the importance of understanding both visuals and text in tandem cannot be understated.* veritable: 진정한  ** in tandem: 동시에① 시각 자료는 정치 관련 보도 자료 연구의 중요한 대상이다.② 전문가들의 의견도 철저하게 검증하고 보도할 필요가 있다.③ 다양한 관심사를 반영하는 뉴스 프로그램 편성이 요구된다.④ 지나치게 방대한 시각 자료는 보도 내용 이해에 방해가 된다.⑤ 언론인은 보도에서 자신의 정치적 편향을 드러내서는 안 된다."

Self­perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character’s personality with the actor’s personality. Audience attribution errors may increase distress in the actor, including fearing that their personality identity is not stable.* visceral: 마음속에서 느끼는  ** dissociative: 분리적인①criteria for evaluating an actor’s performance②difficulties in portraying complicated characters③background knowledge for appreciating the play④confusion of identity between actor and character⑤psychological barriers between actors and the audience"

During his student years at St. John’s College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John’s College has a massive neo­Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled.* decorous: 품위 있는  ** surplice: 흰 가운  *** divest: 벗기다① A Scary Legend About the Statues at St. John’s College② A Student Who Solved a Problem of His Own Making③ Standards of Beauty Varying from Person to Person④ A Smart Professor Who Identified a Criminal⑤ A Success Story of a Mysterious Architect4영어영역고348"

As a child, Shelton took an interest in animals, especially their habits when sick as compared to when well. Shelton attended Bernarr Macfadden’s College of Physcultopathy in Chicago and interned at Crane’s Sanatorium in Elmhurst, Illinois. In 1921, he graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton’s work served as an early influence for the raw food movement. A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti­draft statement in public during the height of World War I. By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from Parkinson’s disease. He died thirteen years later.* anti­draft: 징병 반대의① 병에 걸린 동물의 습성에 관심을 가졌다.② Crane’s Sanatorium에서 인턴으로 일했다.③ 의학적 치료보다 단식을 옹호했다.④ 1917년에 투옥되었다.⑤ 파킨슨병을 앓다가 77세에 사망했다."

In order to make some sense of this, an average wind direction over an hour is sometimes calculated, or sometimes the direction that the wind blew from the most during the hour is recorded. Wind direction is usually measured through the use of a simple vane. ( ①) This is simply a paddle of some sort mounted on a spindle; when it catches the wind, it turns so that the wind passes by without obstruction. ( ②) The direction is recorded, but if you ever have a chance to watch a wind vane on a breezy day, you will notice that there is a lot of variation in the direction of wind flow ― a lot! ( ③) Sometimes the wind can blow from virtually every direction within a minute or two. ( ④) Either way, it is a generalization, and it’s important to remember that there can be a lot of variation in the data. ( ⑤) It’s also important to remember that the data recorded at a weather station give an indication of conditions prevailing in an area but will not be exactly the same as the conditions at a landscape some distance from the weather station. * vane: 풍향계 ** spindle: 회전축 39. Some organizations, however, are unbundling in favor of a more itemized approach sometimes called à la carte pricing. Bundle pricing is packaging together two or more products, usually complementary ones, to be sold for a single price, which is usually considerably less than the sum of the prices of the individual products. ( ①) Bundle pricing facilitates customer satisfaction and, when slow­moving products are bundled with products with higher turnover, can help a company stimulate sales and increase revenues. ( ②) Selling products as a package rather than individually also may result in cost savings, so bundle pricing is commonly used for banking and travel services, computers, and automobiles with option packages. ( ③) This provides customers with the opportunity to pick and choose the products they want without having to purchase bundles that may not be the right mix for their purposes. ( ④) Furthermore, with the help of the Internet, comparison shopping has become more convenient than ever, allowing customers to price items and create their own mixes. ( ⑤) Nevertheless, bundle pricing continues to appeal to customers who prefer the convenience of a package. * à la carte pricing: 따로따로 책정하는 가격 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? The searchability of online works represents a variation on older navigational aids such as tables of contents, indexes, and concordances. But the effects are different. As with links, the ease and ready availability of searching make it much simpler to jump between digital documents than it ever was to jump between printed ones. Our attachment to any one text becomes more tenuous, more transitory. Searches also lead to the fragmentation of online works. A search engine often draws our attention to a particular snippet of text, a few words or sentences that have strong relevance to whatever we’re searching for at the moment, while providing little incentive for taking in the work as a whole. We don’t see the forest when we search the Web. We don’t even see the trees.

        "text": "37.Human movement can be affected, either positively or negatively, by the environment within which the movement takes place. Consider an athlete who runs the 100 m wearing training shoes. She is unlikely to achieve as good a time wearing these shoes as she would if she wore specifically designed spiked running shoes.(A) Is she there because she really wants to be, or is she there just because her brother is also a runner and so her parents bring her along as well? Motivation is a key factor in sports training and performance.(B) On the contrary, if she had a tailwind her performance would be enhanced and movement assisted by the wind. Let us also consider other surrounding circumstances, such as what is motivating the athlete to run.(C) During athletic competitions wind speed is always measured as it is recognised as having an impact, either positively or negatively, on performance times. If our runner was running into a headwind, her speed would be reduced, as some of her force would be needed to overcome the additional obstacle of the wind.① (A) - (C) - (B)② (B) - (A) - (C)③ (B) - (C) - (A)④ (C) - (A) - (B)⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)[38 ~ 39] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오."

In order to make some sense of this, an average wind direction over an hour is sometimes calculated, or sometimes the direction that the wind blew from the most during the hour is recorded. Wind direction is usually measured through the use of a simple vane. ( ①) This is simply a paddle of some sort mounted on a spindle; when it catches the wind, it turns so that the wind passes by without obstruction. ( ②) The direction is recorded, but if you ever have a chance to watch a wind vane on a breezy day, you will notice that there is a lot of variation in the direction of wind flow ― a lot! ( ③) Sometimes the wind can blow from virtually every direction within a minute or two. ( ④) Either way, it is a generalization, and it’s important to remember that there can be a lot of variation in the data.

Some organizations, however, are unbundling in favor of a more itemized approach sometimes called à la carte pricing. Bundle pricing is packaging together two or more products, usually complementary ones, to be sold for a single price, which is usually considerably less than the sum of the prices of the individual products. ( ①) Bundle pricing facilitates customer satisfaction and, when slow­moving products are bundled with products with higher turnover, can help a company stimulate sales and increase revenues. ( ②) Selling products as a package rather than individually also may result in cost savings, so bundle pricing is commonly used for banking and travel services, computers, and automobiles with option packages. ( ③) This provides customers with the opportunity to pick and choose the products they want without having to purchase bundles that may not be the right mix for their purposes. ( ④) Furthermore, with the help of the Internet, comparison shopping has become more convenient than ever, allowing customers to price items and create their own mixes.

At the end of the day (a) he gathered them around to pay them. “What do I owe you, John?” my dad asked the first young man he had hired. “Fifty­five dollars, Mr. Burres,” John said. Dad wrote him a check for fifty­five dollars. “What do I owe you, Michael?” (b) he asked the second young man who had worked the same number of hours as John. “You owe me seventy­five dollars,” Michael said. (B) Again my father was surprised. (c) He asked for clarification. “And how did you arrive at that figure?” The third young man, like the other two, had been hired for the same job and had put in equal time. “Well,” said Nathan, “I didn’t charge you for the lunch break since your wife prepared and served lunch. I didn’t have gas expenses since I came with my buddies. So the actual number of hours worked brings my pay to thirty­eight dollars and fifty cents.” My father wrote him out a check for one hundred dollars.

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) One day my father hired three young men to harvest the crop. At the end of the day (a) he gathered them around to pay them. “What do I owe you, John?” my dad asked the first young man he had hired. “Fifty­five dollars, Mr. Burres,” John said. Dad wrote him a check for fifty­five dollars. “What do I owe you, Michael?” (b) he asked the second young man who had worked the same number of hours as John. “You owe me seventy­five dollars,” Michael said. (B) Again my father was surprised. (c) He asked for clarification. “And how did you arrive at that figure?” The third young man, like the other two, had been hired for the same job and had put in equal time. “Well,” said Nathan, “I didn’t charge you for the lunch break since your wife prepared and served lunch. I didn’t have gas expenses since I came with my buddies. So the actual number of hours worked brings my pay to thirty­eight dollars and fifty cents.” My father wrote him out a check for one hundred dollars. (C) Dad then looked at the three young men ― stricken silent by my father’s actions ― all of whom were a bit bewildered by the differing amounts on their individual check. “I always pay a man his worth, boys. Where I come from we call that equal pay for equal worth.” (d) He looked benevolently at the three young men and in his typical fatherly style added, “The values in a man create the value of a man.” (D) With a look of surprise, my dad asked quietly, “How do you figure that, Michael?” “Oh,” said Michael, “I charge from the time I get into my car to drive to the job site, until the time I get back home, plus gas mileage and meal allowance.” “Meal allowance ― even if we provide the meals?” my dad said. “Yup,” replied Michael. “I see,” said my dad, writing him a check for the seventy­five dollars (e) he requested. “And what about you, Nathan?” Dad inquired. “You owe me thirty­eight dollars and fifty cents, Mr. Burres,” Nathan said. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① Burres 씨는 농작물 수확을 위해 젊은이들을 고용했다. ② Michael은 John보다 더 많은 품삯을 요구했다. ③ Nathan은 점심 식사를 제공받지 못했다. ④ 젊은이들은 수표에 적힌 액수를 보고 약간 어리둥절했다. ⑤ Michael은 일터로 가는 시간을 품삯 계산에 포함했다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오.",
