Therefore, we are asking for parent volunteers to help with directing traffic. The volunteer hours are from 8:00 to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m. on school days. If you are willing to take part in the traffic safety volunteer group, please email us with your preferred schedule at info@techville.edu. Your participation will be helpful in building a safer school environment for our students.

        "text": "20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up.* vulnerability: 취약성①적성을 파악하기 위해서는 자신 있는 일을 다양하게 시도해야 한다.②자신감을 키우기 위해 낯설고 두려운 일에 도전하는 용기를 가져야 한다.③어려운 일을 자신 있게 수행하기 위해 사전에 계획을 철저히 세워야 한다.④과도한 자신감을 갖기보다는 자신의 약점을 객관적으로 분석해야 한다.⑤자신의 경험과 지식을 바탕으로 당면한 문제에 자신 있게 대처해야 한다.   이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.338"

[3점]Gold plating in the project means needlessly enhancing the expected results, namely, adding characteristics that are costly, not required, and that have low added value with respect to the targets ― in other words, giving more with no real justification other than to demonstrate one’s own talent. Gold plating is especially interesting for project team members, as it is typical of projects with a marked professional component ― in other words, projects that involve specialists with proven experience and extensive professional autonomy. In these environments specialists often see the project as an opportunity to test and enrich their skill sets. There is therefore a strong temptation, in all good faith, to engage in gold plating, namely, to achieve more or higher-quality work that gratifies the professional but does not add value to the client’s requests, and at the same time removes valuable resources from the project. As the saying goes, “The best is the enemy of the good.”* autonomy: 자율성** gratify: 만족시키다①Pursuing perfection at work causes conflicts among team members.②Raising work quality only to prove oneself is not desirable.③Inviting overqualified specialists to a project leads to bad ends.④Responding to the changing needs of clients is unnecessary.⑤Acquiring a range of skills for a project does not ensure success."

Multiculturalists suggest that there should be a model of partial assimilation in which immigrants retain some of their customs, beliefs, and language. There is pressure to conform rather than to maintain their cultural identities, however, and these conflicts are greatly determined by the community to which one migrates. These experiences are not new; many Europeans experienced exclusion and poverty during the first two waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eventually, these immigrants transformed this country with significant changes that included enlightenment and acceptance of diversity. People of color, however, continue to struggle for acceptance. Once again, the challenge is to recognize that other cultures think and act differently and that they have the right to do so. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, immigrants will no longer be strangers among us.①이민자 고유의 정체성을 유지할 권리에 대한 공동체의 인식이 필요하다.②이민자의 적응을 돕기 위해 그들의 요구를 반영한 정책 수립이 중요하다.③이민자는 미래 사회의 긍정적 변화에 핵심적 역할을 수행할 수 있다.④다문화 사회의 안정을 위해서는 국제적 차원의 지속적인 협력이 요구된다.⑤문화적 동화는 장기적이고 체계적인 과정을 통해 점진적으로 이루어진다."

To achieve commercial success, that audience must be as large as possible. More than any other characteristics (such as demographic or psychographic profile, purchasing power, level of interest, degree of satisfaction, quality of attention or emotional state), the quantity of an audience aggregated as a mass is the most significant metric for broadcasters seeking to make music radio for profitable ends. As a result, broadcasters attempt to maximise their audience size by playing music that is popular, or ― at the very least ― music that can be relied upon not to cause audiences to switch off their radio or change the station. Audience retention is a key value (if not the key value) for many music programmers and for radio station management. In consequence, a high degree of risk aversion frequently marks out the ‘successful’ radio music programmer. Playlists are restricted, and often very small.* aggregate: 모으다** aversion: 싫어함①features of music playlists appealing to international audiences②influence of advertisers on radio audiences’ musical preferences③difficulties of increasing audience size in radio music programmes④necessity of satisfying listeners’ diverse needs in the radio business⑤outcome of music radio businesses’ attempts to attract large audiences"

Rosen displayed a remarkable talent for the piano from his early childhood. In 1951, the year he earned his doctoral degree in French literature at Princeton University, Rosen made both his New York piano debut and his first recordings. To glowing praise, he appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral concerts around the world. Rosen’s performances impressed some of the 20th century’s most well-known composers, who invited him to play their music. Rosen was also the author of many widely admired books about music. His most famous book, The Classical Style, was first published in 1971 and won the U.S. National Book Award the next year. This work, which was reprinted in an expanded edition in 1997, remains a landmark in the field. While writing extensively, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life until he died in 2012. ①어려서부터 피아노에 재능을 보였다. ②프랑스 문학으로 박사 학위를 받았다. ③유명 작곡가들로부터 그들의 작품 연주를 요청받았다. ④The Classical Style이 처음으로 출판되고 다음 해에 상을 받았다.⑤피아니스트 활동을 중단하고 글쓰기에 매진하였다."

Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t . It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street.①a set of words that allow users to identify an individual object②a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image③a reliable resource for categorizing information by pictures④a primary means of organizing a sequential order of words⑤a useful filter for sorting similar but not identical images이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.668"

Gregor Mendel’s 1865 theories of genetic heredity were correct but ignored for 35 years. His sharp insights were not accepted because they did not explain the problems biologists had at the time, nor did his explanation operate by known mechanisms, so his discoveries were out of reach even for the early adopters. Decades later science faced the urgent questions that Mendel’s discoveries could answer. Now his insights .

        "text": "34. Prior to photography,. While painters have always lifted particular places out of their ‘dwelling’ and transported them elsewhere, paintings were time-consuming to produce, relatively difficult to transport and one-of-a-kind. The multiplication of photographs especially took place with the introduction of the half-tone plate in the 1880s that made possible the mechanical reproduction of photographs in newspapers, periodicals, books and advertisements. Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism’s arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations ... achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass- produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images. Light, small and mass-produced photographs became dynamic vehicles for the spatiotemporal circulation of places.

Only afterwards do we examine (or not examine) more evidence of how things are differentiated, and the degree and significance of the variations.

The real danger of stereotypes is not their inaccuracy, but their lack of flexibility and their tendency to be preserved, even when we have enough time to stop and consider.

(A) In contrast, plants with a history of nutrient abundance are risk averse and save energy. At all developmental stages, plants respond to environmental changes or unevenness so as to be able to use their energy for growth, survival, and reproduction, while limiting damage and nonproductive uses of their valuable energy.(B) Research in this area has shown that plants are constantly aware of their position in the environment, in terms of both space and time. Plants that have experienced variable nutrient availability in the past tend to exhibit risk-taking behaviors, such as spending energy on root lengthening instead of leaf production.(C) But if a plant does not have a caretaker to provide supplemental minerals, it can proliferate or lengthen its roots and develop root hairs to allow foraging in more distant soil patches. Plants can also use their memory to respond to histories of temporal or spatial variation in nutrient or resource availability.

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never ― for lack of archives ― been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.󰀻While historical fiction reconstructs the past using (A)evidence, it provides an inviting description, which may(B)people’s understanding of historical events.(A)(B)(A)(B)①insignificant ……delay②insufficient……enrich③concrete……enhance④outdated……improve⑤limited……disturb이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.888[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.One reason we think we forget most of what we learned in school is that we underestimate what we actually remember.
