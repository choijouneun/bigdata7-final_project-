Remembering the surgery, he said to himself, “I thought my basketball career was completely over.” However, upon hearing his fans’ wild cheers, he felt his body coming alive and thought, “For sure, my fans, friends, and family are looking forward to watching me play today.” As soon as the game started, he was filled with energy.

Computer companies have even begun to advertise ways in which computers can replace parents. They are too late ―television has already done that.  Seriously, however, in every branch of education, including moral education, we make a mistake when we suppose that a particular batch of content or a particular teaching method or a particular configuration of students and space will accomplish our ends. The answer is both harder and simpler. We, parents and teachers, have to live with our children, talk to them, listen to them, enjoy their company, and show them by what we do and how we talk that it is possible to live appreciatively or, at least, nonviolently with most other people.①교육은 일상에서 아이들과의 상호 작용을 통해 이루어져야 한다.②도덕 교육을 강화하여 타인을 배려하는 공동체 의식을 높여야 한다.③텔레비전의 부정적 영향을 줄이려는 사회적 노력이 있어야 한다.④다양한 매체를 활용하여 학교와 가정 교육의 한계를 보완해야 한다.⑤아이들의 온라인 예절 교육을 위해 적절한 콘텐츠를 개발해야 한다.  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.338"

[3점]Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that leaders are uniquely positioned to do, because several obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working alone. For one thing, the fear of being left out of the loop can keep them glued to their enterprise social media. Individuals don’t want to be ―or appear to be ―isolated. For another, knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of comfort and security, because people can adjust their own behavior to be in harmony with the group. It’s risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start. But even though it feels reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected, it’s better for the organization if they periodically go off and think for themselves and generate diverse ―if not quite mature ―ideas. Thus, it becomes the leader’s job to create conditions that are good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even when people wouldn’t choose it for themselves, without making it seem like a punishment.* intermittent: 간헐적인①breaking physical barriers and group norms that prohibit cooperation②having people stop working together and start working individually③encouraging people to devote more time to online collaboration④shaping environments where higher productivity is required⑤requiring workers to focus their attention on group projects"

At the heart of this process is the tension between the professions’ pursuit of autonomy and the public’s demand for accountability. Society’s granting of power and privilege to the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to contribute to social well-being and to conduct their affairs in a manner consistent with broader social values. It has long been recognized that the expertise and privileged position of professionals confer authority and power that could readily be used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they serve. As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago, “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.” Autonomy has never been a one-way street and is never granted absolutely and irreversibly. * autonomy: 자율성** privilege: 특권*** premise: 전제로 말하다①전문직에 부여되는 자율성은 그에 상응하는 사회적 책임을 수반한다.②전문직의 권위는 해당 집단의 이익을 추구하는 데 이용되어 왔다.③전문직의 사회적 책임을 규정할 수 있는 제도 정비가 필요하다.④전문직이 되기 위한 자격 요건은 사회 경제적 요구에 따라 변화해 왔다. ⑤전문직의 업무 성과는 일정 수준의 자율성과 특권이 부여될 때 높아진다."

Insofar as they agree with the underlying concept or idea ―thus possessing the precision that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated ―geometrical shapes can be grasped, but they do not give rise to emotion, and, most importantly, they do not move the imagination to free and new (mental) lengths. Forms or phenomena, on the contrary, that possess a degree of immeasurability, or that do not appear constrained, stimulate the human imagination ―hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience. The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable objects ―indefinable or formless objects ―can be defined as enjoying one’s own emotional and mental activity. Namely, the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to understand and decode the phenomenon present to view. Furthermore, part of the pleasure comes from having one’s comfort zone (momentarily) violated.* geometrical: 기하학의** aesthetic: 심미적인*** sublime: 숭고한①diversity of aesthetic experiences in different eras②inherent beauty in geometrically perfect shapes③concepts of imperfection in modern aesthetics④natural inclination towards aesthetic precision⑤aesthetic pleasure from things unconstrained "

With this administrative management system, urban institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing levels of services to their citizenry, provided through a taxation process and/or fee for services (e.g., police and fire, street maintenance, utilities, waste management, etc.). Frequently this has displaced citizen involvement. Money for services is not a replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation. Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by government being the substitute provider. Consequentially, there is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of responsibility of our urban-based society to become involved. The sense of community and associated responsibility of all citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing. Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can have serious implications. This impedes the nations of the world to be responsive to natural and man-made disasters as part of global preparedness.* supplant: 대신하다** impede: 방해하다①A Sound Citizen Responsibility in a Sound Government②Always Better than Nothing: The Roles of Modern Government③Decreased Citizen Involvement: A Cost of Governmental Services④Why Does Global Citizenship Matter in Contemporary Society?⑤How to Maximize Public Benefits of Urban-Based Society이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.448"

Then, he entered the Royal College of Art in London and earned his degree there. His sculptures, known around the world, present the forms of the body in a unique way. One of his artistic themes was mother-and-child as shown in Madonna and Child at St. Matthew’s Church in Northampton. He achieved financial success from his hard work and established the Henry Moore Foundation to support education and promotion of the arts.①석탄 광부의 일곱 번째 자녀였다.②학창 시절에 일찍이 예술에 재능을 보였다.③런던에 있는 Royal College of Art에서 학위를 취득했다. ④그의 조각은 신체 형태를 독특한 방식으로 나타낸다.⑤경제적으로 성공을 거두지 못했다."

Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult.

Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile.

Given that choice, these companies may choose to leave the green segment of the market to small niche competitors.(B) Even if the green product succeeds, it may cannibalize the company’s higher-profit mainstream offerings. Given such downsides, companies serving mainstream consumers with successful mainstream products face what seems like an obvious investment decision.(C) Furthermore, the restrictive ingredient lists and design criteria that are typical of such products may make green products inferior to mainstream products on core performance dimensions (e.g., less effective cleansers).

Instead, they have a distinct social presence and have visual features suggestive of their ability to interact socially, such as eyes, ears, or a mouth.(C) For instance, in addition to playing music, a social personal assistant robot would express its engagement with the music so that users would feel like they are listening to the music together with the robot.

Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in manageable form. The computer makes available a range of data unattainable in the age of books. It packages it effectively; style is no longer needed to make it accessible, nor is memorization. In dealing with a single decision separated from its context, the computer supplies tools unimaginable even a decade ago. But it also diminishes perspective. Because information is so accessible and communication instantaneous, there is a diminution of focus on its significance, or even on the definition of what is significant. This dynamic may encourage policymakers to wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it, and to regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events rather than part of a historical continuum. When this happens, manipulation of information replaces reflection as the principal policy tool.* retrieve: (정보를) 추출하다** diminution: 감소󰀻Although the computer is clearly (A) at handling information in a decontextualized way, it interferes with our making (B) judgments related to the broader context, as can be seen in policymaking processes.(A)(B)(A)(B)①competent ……comprehensive②dominant……biased③imperfect ……informed④impressive ……legal⑤inefficient ……timely이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.888[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.In studies examining the effectiveness of vitamin C, researchers typically divide the subjects into two groups.
