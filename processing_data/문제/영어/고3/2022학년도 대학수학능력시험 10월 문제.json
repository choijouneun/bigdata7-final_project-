I was going to a conference and my plane was delayed, so by the time I got to my hotel everyone I was supposed to meet had already left for the conference. I walked to the bus stop, but to my dismay the last shuttle to the convention center had already gone. I was at a loss as to what to do! Then a young man standing on the sidewalk said, “The convention center isn’t very far. It’s only four blocks.” So I started walking. It wasn’t long before the convention center appeared in front of my eyes. My heart slowly calmed down! Fortunately, I was just in time for the conference! ① frustrated → relieved ② bored → excited ③ angry → embarrassed ④ envious → ashamed ⑤ doubtful → indifferent 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Bringing incredible creative projects to life demands much hard work down in the trenches of day‑to‑day idea execution. Genius truly is “1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” But we cannot forget the flip side of that 99 percent — it’s impossible to solve every problem by sheer force of will. We must also make time for play, relaxation, and exploration, the essential ingredients of the creative insights that help us evolve existing ideas and set new projects in motion. Often this means creating a routine for breaking from your routine, working on exploratory side projects just for the hell of it, or finding new ways to hotwire your brain’s perspective on a problem. To stay creatively fit, we must keep our minds engaged and on the move — because the greatest enemy of creativity is nothing more than standing still. ① 창의성을 유지할 다양한 경험과 활동을 지속해야 한다. ② 내적 비판과 성찰을 통해 숨은 잠재력을 일깨워야 한다. ③ 일상에서의 관찰을 통해 새로운 아이디어를 얻어야 한다. ④ 혁신적 아이디어를 내려면 기존 사고의 틀을 버려야 한다. ⑤ 추상적인 생각을 뛰어넘어 구체적인 적용을 모색해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 do not have the ears to hear it이 다음 글에서 의미 하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Far from a synonym for capitalism, consumerism makes capitalism impossible over the long term, since it makes capital formation all but impossible. A consumer culture isn’t a saving culture, isn’t a thrift culture. It’s too fixated on buying the next toy to ever delay gratification, to ever save and invest for the future. The point is elementary: you can’t have sustainable capitalism without capital; you can’t have capital without savings; and you can’t save if you’re running around spending everything you’ve just earned. But the confusion has grown so deep that many people today do not have the ears to hear it. Indeed, the policies of our nation’s central bank seem to reinforce this habit by driving down interest rates to near zero and thereby denying people a material reward — in the form of interest on their banked savings — for foregoing consumption. * fixated: 집착하는 ** gratification: 욕구 충족 *** forego: 단념하다 ① disagree with the national policy of lowering interest rates ② ignore the fact that consumerism is a synonym for capitalism ③ believe that consumerism doesn’t really do much for well‑being ④ form a false assumption that savings can make nations prosper ⑤ fail to understand that consumption alone can’t sustain capitalism 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Many people say that we should take full advantage of the privileges of the Internet by forever learning more and more. They see no limit to how much information a person ought to consume and never acknowledge the emotional and psychological cost of cramming facts into our brains. If we aren’t using the wealth of available data to make ourselves more productive and useful to society, what’s the point of having it? While access to information is a privilege, it’s also a burden. This is especially true when we treat being well‑read as an obligation that can’t be escaped. Constant exposure to upsetting news can be traumatic. An unending flood of information makes it hard to pause and reflect on anything you’ve learned. At some point, even the most voracious of readers needs to pull the plug and stop the constant drip of facts, figures, and meaningless Internet fights. We’re living in an era of information overload ─and the solution is not to learn more but to step back and consume a smaller amount of data in a more meaningful way. * voracious: 매우 열심인, 만족을 모르는 ① 정보 습득의 양보다 정보의 유의미한 사용이 더 중요하다. ② 인터넷상의 정보를 비판적으로 바라보는 태도가 필요하다. ③ 인터넷 기술의 발전으로 인해 평생 학습이 실현되고 있다. ④ 인터넷을 통한 의사소통은 사회적 갈등을 유발할 수 있다. ⑤ 정보는 받아들이는 사람의 관점에 따라 달리 해석될 수 있다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Most of us make our career choices when we are about eighteen. At eighteen, you have limited experience, very limited skills and most of what you know comes from your parents, your environment and the structured school system you have gone through. You are usually slightly better at some skills because you have spent a bit more time on them. Maybe someone in your environment was good at something and passionate enough to get you interested in spending more time in that area. It is also possible that you might have a specific physical feature — such as being tall — that might make you better at certain activities, such as playing basketball. In any case, most people make a decision regarding their career and direction in life based on their limited experiences and biases in their childhood and teenage years. This decision will come to dominate their life for many years to come. No wonder so many get it wrong! It is easier to get it wrong than to get it right, because statistically, there are more wrong ways than right ways. ① social factors that make employment unstable ② useful statistics for making a right career choice ③ reasons that an early career choice can go wrong ④ necessity to find one’s aptitude as early as possible ⑤ how to overcome biases in making one’s career choices 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? In making sense of cave art, anthropologists have turned to surviving hunter‑gatherer societies that continue to paint inside caves, particularly the San peoples, who live in communities across a wide region of southern Africa. What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture.

Gilbert Stuart에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Gilbert Stuart grew up in the American colony of Rhode Island before the United States was an independent nation. He traveled to Scotland, England, and Ireland to study art. He then returned to America about the time the war for independence broke out, but he returned to Europe once again because the war made his career as an artist difficult. Even so, he didn’t find much success until he came back to the United States in 1795, when he painted a portrait of George Washington. Stuart is called the “father of American portraiture” because he painted pictures of all the famous people of early America. One of his paintings of George Washington was hung in the White House. The image of Washington on the U.S. one‑dollar bill came from one of Stuart’s most famous paintings of Washington. In 1824, Stuart suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, but he still continued to paint for two years until his death on July 9, 1828. ① 미술 공부를 위해 스코틀랜드, 잉글랜드, 아일랜드로 갔다. ② 독립 전쟁으로 인해 화가로서 일하는 것이 어려워졌다. ③ 초기 미국의 모든 유명인의 초상화를 그렸다. ④ 그가 그린 초상화가 미국 1달러 지폐에 사용되었다. ⑤ 뇌졸중을 겪은 후 더 이상 그림을 그리지 않았다. 27.

The idea that leaders inherently possess certain physical, intellectual, or personality traits that distinguish them from nonleaders ①was the foundational belief of the trait‑based approach to leadership. This approach dominated leadership research from the late 1800s until the mid‑1940s and has experienced a resurgence of interest in the last couple of decades.

Thus, early research in this area often presented the widely stated argument ③that “leaders are born, not made.” Also, some of the earliest leadership studies were grounded in what ④referred to as the “great man” theory because researchers at the time focused on identifying traits of highly visible leaders in history who were typically male and associated with the aristocracy or political or military leadership.

I was going to a conference and my plane was delayed, so by the time I got to my hotel everyone I was supposed to meet had already left for the conference. I walked to the bus stop, but to my dismay the last shuttle to the convention center had already gone. I was at a loss as to what to do! Then a young man standing on the sidewalk said, “The convention center isn’t very far. It’s only four blocks.” So I started walking. It wasn’t long before the convention center appeared in front of my eyes. My heart slowly calmed down! Fortunately, I was just in time for the conference! ① frustrated → relieved ② bored → excited ③ angry → embarrassed ④ envious → ashamed ⑤ doubtful → indifferent 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Bringing incredible creative projects to life demands much hard work down in the trenches of day‑to‑day idea execution. Genius truly is “1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” But we cannot forget the flip side of that 99 percent — it’s impossible to solve every problem by sheer force of will. We must also make time for play, relaxation, and exploration, the essential ingredients of the creative insights that help us evolve existing ideas and set new projects in motion. Often this means creating a routine for breaking from your routine, working on exploratory side projects just for the hell of it, or finding new ways to hotwire your brain’s perspective on a problem. To stay creatively fit, we must keep our minds engaged and on the move — because the greatest enemy of creativity is nothing more than standing still. ① 창의성을 유지할 다양한 경험과 활동을 지속해야 한다. ② 내적 비판과 성찰을 통해 숨은 잠재력을 일깨워야 한다. ③ 일상에서의 관찰을 통해 새로운 아이디어를 얻어야 한다. ④ 혁신적 아이디어를 내려면 기존 사고의 틀을 버려야 한다. ⑤ 추상적인 생각을 뛰어넘어 구체적인 적용을 모색해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 do not have the ears to hear it이 다음 글에서 의미 하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Far from a synonym for capitalism, consumerism makes capitalism impossible over the long term, since it makes capital formation all but impossible. A consumer culture isn’t a saving culture, isn’t a thrift culture. It’s too fixated on buying the next toy to ever delay gratification, to ever save and invest for the future. The point is elementary: you can’t have sustainable capitalism without capital; you can’t have capital without savings; and you can’t save if you’re running around spending everything you’ve just earned. But the confusion has grown so deep that many people today do not have the ears to hear it. Indeed, the policies of our nation’s central bank seem to reinforce this habit by driving down interest rates to near zero and thereby denying people a material reward — in the form of interest on their banked savings — for foregoing consumption. * fixated: 집착하는 ** gratification: 욕구 충족 *** forego: 단념하다 ① disagree with the national policy of lowering interest rates ② ignore the fact that consumerism is a synonym for capitalism ③ believe that consumerism doesn’t really do much for well‑being ④ form a false assumption that savings can make nations prosper ⑤ fail to understand that consumption alone can’t sustain capitalism 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Many people say that we should take full advantage of the privileges of the Internet by forever learning more and more. They see no limit to how much information a person ought to consume and never acknowledge the emotional and psychological cost of cramming facts into our brains. If we aren’t using the wealth of available data to make ourselves more productive and useful to society, what’s the point of having it? While access to information is a privilege, it’s also a burden. This is especially true when we treat being well‑read as an obligation that can’t be escaped. Constant exposure to upsetting news can be traumatic. An unending flood of information makes it hard to pause and reflect on anything you’ve learned. At some point, even the most voracious of readers needs to pull the plug and stop the constant drip of facts, figures, and meaningless Internet fights. We’re living in an era of information overload ─and the solution is not to learn more but to step back and consume a smaller amount of data in a more meaningful way. * voracious: 매우 열심인, 만족을 모르는 ① 정보 습득의 양보다 정보의 유의미한 사용이 더 중요하다. ② 인터넷상의 정보를 비판적으로 바라보는 태도가 필요하다. ③ 인터넷 기술의 발전으로 인해 평생 학습이 실현되고 있다. ④ 인터넷을 통한 의사소통은 사회적 갈등을 유발할 수 있다. ⑤ 정보는 받아들이는 사람의 관점에 따라 달리 해석될 수 있다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Most of us make our career choices when we are about eighteen. At eighteen, you have limited experience, very limited skills and most of what you know comes from your parents, your environment and the structured school system you have gone through. You are usually slightly better at some skills because you have spent a bit more time on them. Maybe someone in your environment was good at something and passionate enough to get you interested in spending more time in that area. It is also possible that you might have a specific physical feature — such as being tall — that might make you better at certain activities, such as playing basketball. In any case, most people make a decision regarding their career and direction in life based on their limited experiences and biases in their childhood and teenage years. This decision will come to dominate their life for many years to come. No wonder so many get it wrong! It is easier to get it wrong than to get it right, because statistically, there are more wrong ways than right ways. ① social factors that make employment unstable ② useful statistics for making a right career choice ③ reasons that an early career choice can go wrong ④ necessity to find one’s aptitude as early as possible ⑤ how to overcome biases in making one’s career choices 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? In making sense of cave art, anthropologists have turned to surviving hunter‑gatherer societies that continue to paint inside caves, particularly the San peoples, who live in communities across a wide region of southern Africa. What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stage of a trance, Lewis‑Williams writes, ‘people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations’. For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into ‘a single process’ that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that ‘can influence and be influenced’. * hyperventilation: 과호흡 ** trance: 무아지경 *** exalt: 의기양양하게 하다 ① Cave Paintings: The Dawn of Human Creativity ② Early Humans’ Communication Through Cave Art ③ Hardships of Early Humans Depicted in Cave Art ④ Shamanistic Culture for Paying Honor to Ancestors ⑤ Animal Imitation Rituals and Understanding Cave Art 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

[3점]Far from a synonym for capitalism, consumerism makes capitalism impossible over the long term, since it makes capital formation all but impossible. A consumer culture isn’t a saving culture, isn’t a thrift culture. It’s too fixated on buying the next toy to ever delay gratification, to ever save and invest for the future. The point is elementary: you can’t have sustainable capitalism without capital; you can’t have capital without savings; and you can’t save if you’re running around spending everything you’ve just earned. But the confusion has grown so deep that many people today do not have the ears to hear it. Indeed, the policies of our nation’s central bank seem to reinforce this habit by driving down interest rates to near zero and thereby denying people a material reward — in the form of interest on their banked savings — for foregoing consumption.* fixated: 집착하는  ** gratification: 욕구 충족  *** forego: 단념하다① disagree with the national policy of lowering interest rates② ignore the fact that consumerism is a synonym for capitalism③ believe that consumerism doesn’t really do much for well‑being④ form a false assumption that savings can make nations prosper⑤ fail to understand that consumption alone can’t sustain capitalism"

They see no limit to how much information a person ought to consume and never acknowledge the emotional and psychological cost of cramming facts into our brains. If we aren’t using the wealth of available data to make ourselves more productive and useful to society, what’s the point of having it? While access to information is a privilege, it’s also a burden. This is especially true when we treat being well‑read as an obligation that can’t be escaped. Constant exposure to upsetting news can be traumatic. An unending flood of information makes it hard to pause and reflect on anything you’ve learned. At some point, even the most voracious of readers needs to pull the plug and stop the constant drip of facts, figures, and meaningless Internet fights. We’re living in an era of information overload ─and the solution is not to learn more but to step back and consume a smaller amount of data in a more meaningful way.* voracious: 매우 열심인, 만족을 모르는① 정보 습득의 양보다 정보의 유의미한 사용이 더 중요하다.② 인터넷상의 정보를 비판적으로 바라보는 태도가 필요하다.③ 인터넷 기술의 발전으로 인해 평생 학습이 실현되고 있다.④ 인터넷을 통한 의사소통은 사회적 갈등을 유발할 수 있다.⑤ 정보는 받아들이는 사람의 관점에 따라 달리 해석될 수 있다."

At eighteen, you have limited experience, very limited skills and most of what you know comes from your parents, your environment and the structured school system you have gone through. You are usually slightly better at some skills because you have spent a bit more time on them. Maybe someone in your environment was good at something and passionate enough to get you interested in spending more time in that area. It is also possible that you might have a specific physical feature — such as being tall —that might make you better at certain activities, such as playing basketball. In any case, most people make a decision regarding their career and direction in life based on their limited experiences and biases in their childhood and teenage years. This decision will come to dominate their life for many years to come. No wonder so many get it wrong!

What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stage of a trance, Lewis‑Williams writes, ‘people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations’. For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into ‘a single process’ that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that ‘can influence and be influenced’.* hyperventilation: 과호흡  ** trance: 무아지경*** exalt: 의기양양하게 하다 ① Cave Paintings: The Dawn of Human Creativity② Early Humans’ Communication Through Cave Art③ Hardships of Early Humans Depicted in Cave Art④ Shamanistic Culture for Paying Honor to Ancestors⑤ Animal Imitation Rituals and Understanding Cave Art4영어영역고348"

Ecological health depends on keeping the surface of the earth rich in humus and minerals so that it can provide a foundation for healthy plant and animal life. The situation is disrupted if the soil loses these raw materials or if __________________________________________. When man goes beneath the surface of the earth and drags out minerals or other compounds that did not evolve as part of this system, then problems follow. The mining of lead and cadmium are examples of this. Petroleum is also a substance that has been dug out of the bowels of the earth and introduced into the surface ecology by man.

Magical thinking, intellectual insecurity, and confirmation bias are all powerful barriers to scientific discovery; they blocked the eyes of generations of astronomers before Copernicus. But as twenty‑first‑century researchers have discovered, these three barriers can all be destroyed with a simple teaching trick: transporting our brain to an environment outside our own. That environment can be a nature preserve many miles from our home, or a computer‑simulated Mars, or any other space that our ego doesn’t associate directly with our health, social status, and material success. In that environment, our ego will be less inclined to take the failure of its predictions personally. Certainly, our ego may feel a little upset that its guesses about the nature preserve or Mars were wrong, but it was never really that invested in the guesses to begin with. Why should it care too much about things that have no bearing on its own fame or well‑being? So, in that happy state of apathy, our ego is less likely to get data manipulative, mentally threatened, or magically minded, leaving the rest of our brain free to . * apathy: 무관심 ① do away with irregularity and seek harmony ② justify errors by reorganizing remaining data ③ build barriers to avoid intellectual insecurity ④ abandon failed hypotheses and venture new ones ⑤ manipulate the surroundings and support existing ideas 34. If you are unconvinced that _____________________________, consider the example of the “flying horse.” Depictions of galloping horses from prehistoric times up until the mid‑1800s typically showed horses’ legs splayed while galloping, that is, the front legs reaching far ahead as the hind legs stretched far behind. People just “knew” that’s how horses galloped, and that is how they “saw” them galloping. Cavemen saw them this way, Aristotle saw them this way, and so did Victorian gentry. But all of that ended when, in 1878, Eadweard Muybridge published a set of twelve pictures he had taken of a galloping horse in the space of less than half a second using twelve cameras hooked to wire triggers. Muybridge’s photos showed clearly that a horse goes completely airborne in the third step of the gallop with its legs collected beneath it, not splayed. It is called the moment of suspension. Now even kids draw horses galloping this way. * gallop: 질주(하다) ** splay: 벌리다 *** gentry: 상류층 ① our beliefs influence how we interpret facts ② what we see is an illusion of our past memories ③ even photographs can lead to a wrong visual perception ④ there is no standard by which we can judge good or bad ⑤ we adhere to our intuition in spite of irresistible evidence 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?

It liberated hominin arms for carrying weapons and for taking food to group sites instead of consuming it on the spot. But bipedalism was necessary to trigger hand dexterity and tool use.(A) This creates the ability to use each digit independently in the complex manipulations required for tool use. But without bipedalism it would be impossible to use the trunk for leverage in accelerating the hand during toolmaking and tool use.(B) Hashimoto and co‑workers concluded that adaptations underlying tool use evolved independently of those required for human bipedalism because in both humans and monkeys, each finger is represented separately in the primary sensorimotor cortex, just as the fingers are physically separated in the hand.(C) Bipedalism also freed the mouth and teeth to develop a more complex call system as the prerequisite of language. These developments required larger brains whose energy cost eventually reached three times the level for chimpanzees, accounting for up to one‑sixth of the total basal metabolic rate.

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) As a twelve‑year‑old, Richard Feynman set up a little lab in his room, bought his first radio and, rather than listening to it, he took it apart. (a) He soon became quite good at fixing radios. This was in the early 1930s, during the Great Depression, so a boy who could fix radios cheaply was useful. On one occasion, he was picked up by a client who seemed far from convinced that this boy wouldn’t be a waste of his time and money. (B) After a while, Feynman came up with a theory: Radio sets in those days were made from a series of tubes. If (b) he took them out and reversed the order, the vibration and noise might disappear. Now, at last, Feynman was ready to act. He changed the tubes and turned the radio on. It worked perfectly. The client was astonished. He became one of Feynman’s biggest advocates, telling everyone (c) he knew of the boy who “fixes radios by thinking.” * tube: 진공관 (C) The client kept on asking Feynman how a boy could know anything useful about radios until they arrived at the client’s poorhouse. Feeling pressured, Feynman turned the radio on. It started wobbling, then gave out a terrifically loud roar for a few minutes before quieting and playing correctly. (d) He was confused. He had never encountered this before. He shut the radio off, began walking around in the room and thinking. * wobble: 떨리다 (D) The client was entirely unimpressed. He wanted action, and he wanted to see the boy working. He started protesting to Feynman, asking him to stop wasting his time and get on with fixing the radio, or leave. Despite the heckling, Feynman kept on thinking. He wondered how any radio could make such a noise. Most radios failed because of faulty equipment or loose wiring; (e) he wasn’t convinced it would be either. * heckling: 방해 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① Feynman은 처음 산 라디오를 분해했다. ② 고객은 Feynman의 가장 큰 지지자 중 한 사람이 되었다. ③ Feynman은 고객으로부터 계속 질문을 받았다. ④ Feynman은 라디오를 끄고 방을 나갔다. ⑤ Feynman은 라디오 소음의 원인에 대해 궁금해 했다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오.",
