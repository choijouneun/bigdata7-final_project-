Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the choice often ends up with us making a suboptimal choice. Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. The mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure.

[3점]Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal diary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason and critique to the understanding of world and self, which allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were central media through which enlightened and free subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and explored with words” emerges. Diaries were personal and private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas’s formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself. By making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became an object for self-inspection and self-critique.* disparate: 이질적인** render: 만들다①use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself②build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries③exchange feedback in the process of writing④create an alternate ego to present to others⑤develop topics for writing about selfhood"

The latter have the potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly in high-density and congested areas. In locations where bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g. groceries). Due to their low acquisition and maintenance costs, cargo bicycles convey much potential in developed and developing countries alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. Services using electrically assisted delivery tricycles have been successfully implemented in France and are gradually being adopted across Europe for services as varied as parcel and catering deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is particularly encouraged when combined with policies that restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as downtown or commercial districts, or with the extension of dedicated bike lanes.①도시에서 자전거는 효율적인 배송 수단으로 사용될 수 있다.②자전거는 출퇴근 시간을 줄이기 위한 대안으로 선호되고 있다.③자전거는 배송 수단으로의 경제적 장단점을 모두 가질 수 있다.④수요자의 요구에 부합하는 다양한 용도의 자전거가 개발되고 있다.⑤세계 각국에서는 전기 자전거 사용을 장려하는 정책을 추진하고 있다."

[3점]An important advantage of disclosure, as opposed to more aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for the operation of free markets. Regulatory mandates are blunt swords; they tend to neglect diversity and may have serious unintended adverse effects. For example, energy efficiency requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less well or that have characteristics that consumers do not want. Information provision, by contrast, respects freedom of choice. If automobile manufacturers are required to measure and publicize the safety characteristics of cars, potential car purchasers can trade safety concerns against other attributes, such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed of the calories in their meals, those who want to lose weight can make use of the information, leaving those who are unconcerned about calories unaffected. Disclosure does not interfere with, and should even promote, the autonomy (and quality) of individual decision-making.* mandate: 명령** adverse: 거스르는*** autonomy: 자율성①steps to make public information accessible to customers ②benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices③strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market④necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends⑤effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices"

Cells that help your hand muscles reach out to an object need to know the size and location of the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that help you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object sees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape, another sees color, another detects location, and another perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it without seeing whether it is moving.①Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!②Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells③Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain④Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process⑤Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.4홀수형48"

Later, Luhmann developed his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a professor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld. He researched a variety of subjects, including mass media and law.

The ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do.

It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities.

Forexample, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s need.

Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works well enough. In the case of climate change, however, the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has been desperately misleading and has, most importantly, hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that . It is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and future do not arise naturally.

The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to defend itself against predators. If the water around it doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.(C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.* spine: 가시 돌기** conducive: 도움되는①(A) －(C) －(B)②(B) －(A) －(C)③(B) －(C) －(A)④(C) －(A) －(B)⑤(C) －(B) －(A)이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.홀수형778"

        "text": "37.The most commonly known form of results-based pricing is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.(A) Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are unfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take years to settle.(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they pay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value of the service is hard to determine before the service, and providers develop a price that allows them to share the risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury and certain consumer cases are billed. In this approach, lawyers do not receive fees or payment until the case is settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that the client receives.

There’s a reason for that: traditionally, park designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing other means of partition. Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society.

Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; the desire to do something well for its own sake can be weakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by obsession.* swath: 구획󰀻Craftsmanship, a human desire that has(A)over time in diverse contexts, often encounters factors that (B)its full development.(A)(B)(A)(B)①persisted…limit②persisted…cultivate③evolved…accelerate④diminished …shape⑤diminished …restrict이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.8홀수형88[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.There is evidence that even very simple algorithms can outperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems.
