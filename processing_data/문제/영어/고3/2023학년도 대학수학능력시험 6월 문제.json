She was deeply concerned about how much it was going to cost to get her car fixed. Her car’s engine had started making noises and kept losing power that morning, and she had heard that replacing an engine could be very expensive. After a few minutes, the mechanic came back into the waiting room. “I’ve got some good news. It was just a dirty spark plug. I already wiped it clean and your car is as good as new.” He handed her the bill and when she checked it, the overall cost of repairs came to less than ten dollars. That was far less than she had expected and she felt at ease, knowing she could easily afford it.①worried→relieved②calm→terrified③bored→thrilled④excited →scared⑤disappointed →indifferent"

However, development of creative ability in one domain may enhance effectiveness in other domains that require similar skills, and flexible switching between generality and specificity is helpful to productivity in many domains. Excessive specificity may result in information from outside the domain being underestimated and unavailable, which leads to fixedness of thinking, whereas excessive generality causes chaos, vagueness, and shallowness. Both tendencies pose a threat to the transfer of knowledge and skills between domains. What should therefore be optimal for the development of cross-domain creativity is support for young people in taking up creative challenges in a specific domain and coupling it with encouragement to apply knowledge and skills in, as well as from, other domains, disciplines, and tasks.①창의성을 개발하기 위해서는 도전과 실패를 두려워하지 말아야 한다.②전문 지식과 기술을 전수하려면 집중적인 투자가 선행되어야 한다.③창의적인 인재를 육성하기 위해 다양한 교육과정을 준비해야 한다.④특정 영역에서 개발된 창의성이 영역 간 활용되도록 장려해야 한다.⑤조기 교육을 통해 특정 분야의 전문가를 지속적으로 양성해야 한다.  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.338"

This metaphor was introduced about a century ago, and it has dramatically transformed the teaching and practice of law. The metaphor is useful because it helps us see ownership as a grouping of interpersonal rights that can be separated and put back together. When you say It’s mine in reference to a resource, often that means you own a lot of the sticks that make up the full bundle: the sell stick, the rent stick, the right to mortgage, license, give away, even destroy the thing. Often, though, we split the sticks up, as for a piece of land: there may be a landowner, a bank with a mortgage, a tenant with a lease, a plumber with a license to enter the land, an oil company with mineral rights. Each of these parties owns a stick in the bundle.* mortgage: 저당잡히다** tenant: 임차인①a legal obligation to develop the resource②a priority to legally claim the real estate③a right to use one aspect of the property④a building to be shared equally by tenants⑤a piece of land nobody can claim as their own"

Given the level of anonymity with all that resides on the Internet, it’s sensible to question the validity of any data that you may receive. Typically it’s to our natural instinct when we meet someone coming down a sidewalk to place yourself in some manner of protective position, especially when they introduce themselves as having known you, much to your surprise. By design, we set up challenges in which the individual must validate how they know us by presenting scenarios, names or acquaintances, or evidence by which to validate (that is, photographs). Once we have received that information and it has gone through a cognitive validation, we accept that person as more trustworthy. All this happens in a matter of minutes but is a natural defense mechanism that we perform in the real world. However, in the virtual world, we have a tendency to be less defensive, as there appears to be no physical threat to our well-being.* paranoid: 편집성의** anonymity: 익명①가상 세계 특유의 익명성 때문에 표현의 자유가 남용되기도 한다.②인터넷 정보의 신뢰도를 검증하는 기술은 점진적으로 향상되고 있다.③가상 세계에서는 현실 세계와 달리 자유로운 정보 공유가 가능하다.④안전한 인터넷 환경 구축을 위해 보안 프로그램을 설치하는 것이 좋다.⑤방어 기제가 덜 작동하는 가상 세계에서는 신중한 정보 검증이 중요하다."

In an era when museums are forced to increase their earnings, they often focus their energies on modernising their galleries or mounting temporary exhibitions to bring more and more audiences through the door. In other words, as museums struggle to survive in a competitive economy, their budgets often prioritise those parts of themselves that are consumable: infotainment in the galleries, goods and services in the cafes and the shops. The unlit, unglamorous storerooms, if they are ever discussed, are at best presented as service areas that process objects for the exhibition halls. And at worst, as museums pour more and more resources into their publicly visible faces, the spaces of storage may even suffer, their modernisation being kept on hold or being given less and less space to house the expanding collections and serve their complex conservation needs.①importance of prioritising museums’ exhibition spaces②benefits of diverse activities in museums for audiences③necessity of expanding storerooms for displaying objects④consequences of profit-oriented management of museums⑤ways to increase museums’ commitment to the public good"

By 2005, approximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day in cities worldwide. In 2050, there may be three to four times as many passenger-kilometres travelled as in the year 2000, infrastructure and energy prices permitting. Freight movement could also rise more than threefold during the same period. Mobility flows have become a key dynamic of urbanization, with the associated infrastructure invariably constituting the backbone of urban form. Yet, despite the increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access to places, activities and services has become increasingly difficult. Not only is it less convenient ― in terms of time, cost and comfort ―to access locations in cities, but the very process of moving around in cities generates a number of negative externalities. Accordingly, many of the world’s cities face an unprecedented accessibility crisis, and are characterized by unsustainable mobility systems.* freight: 화물①Is Hyper-mobility Always Good for Cities?②Accessibility: A Guide to a Web of Urban Areas③A Long and Winding Road to Economic Success④Inevitable Regional Conflicts from Hyper-mobility⑤Infrastructure: An Essential Element of Hyper-mobility이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.448"

He and the rest of the Renoir family were the models of many of his father’s paintings. At the outbreak of World War I, Jean Renoir was serving in the French army but was wounded in the leg. In 1937, he made La Grande Illusion, one of his better-known films. It was enormously successful but was not allowed to show in Germany. During World War II, when the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he went to Hollywood in the United States and continued his career there. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the Academy Honorary Award in 1975 for his lifetime achievements in the film industry. Overall, Jean Renoir’s influence as a film-maker and artist endures.①유명 화가의 아들이었다.②제1차 세계대전이 발발했을 때 프랑스 군에 복무 중이었다. ③La Grande Illusion을 1937년에 만들었다.④제2차 세계대전 내내 프랑스에 머물렀다.⑤Academy Honorary Award를 수상하였다."

[3점]To the extent that an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy. A rational agent should be autonomous ―it should learn what it can to (A) compensate / prepare for partial or incorrect prior knowledge. For example, a vacuum-cleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not. As a practical matter, one seldom requires complete autonomy from the start: when the agent has had little or no experience, it would have to act (B) purposefully / randomly unless the designer gave some assistance. So, just as evolution provides animals with enough built-in reflexes to survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn. After sufficient experience of its environment, the behavior of a rational agent can become effectively (C) independent / protective of its prior knowledge. Hence, the incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments.(A)(B)(C)①compensate…… randomly…… protective②compensate…… purposefully …… protective③prepare…… randomly…… protective④compensate…… randomly…… independent⑤prepare…… purposefully …… independent[31～34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오."

Consumption is becoming progressively less determined by the need for sustenance and the practical use of the goods consumed. People still eat, but a growing component of food’s value is determined by its aspects. People pay a premium to eat exotic cuisines that provide an interesting experience or that symbolize a distinctive life-style.

The group has a sense of moral community based on years of trust and sharing. In a certain community of North America, labor sharing is a major economic factor of social cohesion.

        "text": "34. One of the common themes of the Western philosophical tradition is the distinction between sensual perceptions and rational knowledge. Since Plato, the supremacy of rational reason is based on the assertion that it is able to extract true knowledge from experience. As the discussion in the Republic helps to explain, perceptions are inherently unreliable and misleading because the senses are subject to errors and illusions. Only the rational discourse has the tools to overcome illusions and to point towards true knowledge. For instance, perception suggests that a figure in the distance is smaller than it really is. Yet, the application of logical reasoning will reveal that the figure only appears small because it obeys the laws of geometrical perspective. Nevertheless, even after the perspectival correction is applied and reason concludes that perception is misleading, the figure still appears small, and the truth of the matter is revealed .

Interestingly, if someone blushes after making a social mistake, they are viewed in a more favourable light than those who don’t blush.(B) If we feel awkward, embarrassed or ashamed when we are alone, we don’t blush; it seems to be caused by our concern about what others are thinking of us. Studies have confirmed that simply being told you are blushing brings it on. We feel as though others can see through our skin and into our mind. (C) However, while we sometimes want to disappear when we involuntarily go bright red, psychologists argue that blushing actually serves a positive social purpose.

It follows that natural selection is unlikely to lead to the evolution of perfect, ‘maximally fit’ individuals. Rather, organisms come to match their environments by being ‘the fittest available’ or ‘the fittest yet’: they are not ‘the best imaginable’. Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives. Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism’s remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics ― evolutionary ‘baggage’ ― that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column. Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints: koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage.* vertebrate: 척추동물󰀻The survival characteristics that an organism currently carries may act as a(n)(A)to its adaptability when the organism finds itself coping with changes that arise in its(B).(A)(B)(A)(B)①improvement …… diet②obstacle ……surroundings③advantage…… genes④regulator ……mechanisms⑤guide…… traits이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.888[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.Many negotiators assume that all negotiations involve a fixed pie.
