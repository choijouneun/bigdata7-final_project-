After going through her routine chores as a nanny, Melanie realized how quiet the house was without Edith and Harry stirring around in it. She realized that she couldn’t hear any noise other than the ones she made. She missed Edith. She missed Harry. She felt alone in this big house without the twins. Suddenly she realized that she’d never been in any other rooms except her bedroom and the twins’. It occurred to her that the study upstairs was always kept closed. She wondered what interesting things would be there. Books? Magazines? Perhaps... a beautiful painting? She couldn’t resist herself and started heading up the stairs. ① lonely → curious ② surprised → worried ③ indifferent → upset ④ comfortable → annoyed ⑤ disappointed → relieved 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? It’s unfortunate that when something goes wrong, people obsess about why it happened, whose fault it was, and “why me?” Honestly, what good is that thinking in most cases? Train your brain to be solution­oriented. Let’s take the simplest example on the planet. What happens when a glass of milk spills? Yes, you can obsess and say, how did that fall, who made it fall, will it stain the floor, or think something along the lines of, “Why always me? I’m in a hurry and don’t need this.” But someone with a solution­oriented thought process would simply get a towel, pick up the glass, and get a new glass of milk. Use your energy wisely; learn from mistakes but then move on fast with solutions. ① 문제가 생기면 주위 사람들에게 조언을 구하라. ② 비판하는 사람보다 격려하는 사람을 가까이하라. ③ 실패의 경험을 분석해서 배우려는 자세를 가져라. ④ 문제 자체에 집착하기보다는 문제 해결에 집중하라. ⑤ 예상치 못한 위험에 대비해 항상 경계를 늦추지 마라. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 live in the tightest echo chambers가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? What happens when students get the message that saying the wrong thing can get you in trouble? They do what one would expect: they talk to people they already agree with, keep their mouths shut about important topics in mixed company, and often don’t bother even arguing with the angriest or loudest person in the room. The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it? A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.” ① hear only the voices that strengthen their views ② have mixed feelings towards the academic world ③ find their followers from every corner of society ④ be responsive to emotional cues from their peers ⑤ blame educational systems for the social polarization 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Some company leaders say that their company is going through a lot of change and stress, which they “know” will lower their effectiveness, drive away top talent, and tear apart their teams. They need to think about the military, a place where stress and uncertainty are the status quo, and where employees are on­boarded not with a beach vacation but with boot camp. And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential. * status quo: 현 상태 ** boot camp: 신병 훈련소 ① 적절한 긴장감은 사고를 예방하는 데 도움이 된다. ② 신속함보다는 정확한 업무 처리가 생산성을 개선한다. ③ 목표 설정이 구체적일수록 성과를 빨리 달성할 수 있다. ④ 인적 자원에 대한 투자는 조직에 대한 충성심을 높인다. ⑤ 스트레스를 조직의 잠재력을 끌어낼 계기로 삼을 수 있다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Inspiration is a funny thing. It’s powerful enough to move mountains. When it strikes, it carries an author forward like the rushing torrents of a flooded river. And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created ― mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted ― by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner. This is the principle way writers finish 50,000 words of a novel each year during National Novel Writing Month ― by showing up ― and it applies to being creative the rest of the year as well. * torrent: 급류 ** saga: 대하소설 ① crucial roles of persistent effort in creative writing ② distinctive features of popular contemporary novels ③ importance of detailed description in writing fiction ④ revival of reading novels as a form of entertainment ⑤ classical literature as a timeless source of inspiration 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Hierarchies are good at weeding out obviously bad ideas. By the time an idea makes it all the way up the chain, it will have been compared to all the other ideas in the system, with the obviously good ideas ranked at the top. This seems like common sense. The problem is that obviously good ideas are not truly innovative, and truly innovative ideas often look like very bad ideas when they’re introduced. Western Union famously passed on the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents and technology for the telephone. At the time, phone calls were extremely noisy and easy to misinterpret, and they couldn’t span long distances, and Western Union knew from its telegram business that profitable communication depended on accuracy and widespread reach.

Virginia Apgar에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Born in 1909, Virginia Apgar was determined to succeed in the field of medicine. She graduated from medical school and completed an internship in surgery. But she soon found that her employment options were limited. Apgar tried something new, focusing her efforts on anesthesiology. After being denied several times, she was accepted into a training program in anesthesiology. As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies. During this time, she developed the Apgar score, which is a method of checking the health of a newborn. According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies. She received many awards including an honorary doctorate from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1964. In 1973, she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the Ladies Home Journal. * anesthesiology: 마취학 ① 의과 대학 졸업 후 외과에서 인턴 과정을 마쳤다. ② 단번에 마취학 훈련 과정 입학을 허가받았다. ③ 산모 마취가 아기에게 미치는 영향에 관심을 가졌다. ④ 신생아의 건강을 확인하는 방법을 개발했다. ⑤ 명예박사 학위를 포함하여 많은 상을 받았다. 27.

After going through her routine chores as a nanny, Melanie realized how quiet the house was without Edith and Harry stirring around in it. She realized that she couldn’t hear any noise other than the ones she made. She missed Edith. She missed Harry. She felt alone in this big house without the twins. Suddenly she realized that she’d never been in any other rooms except her bedroom and the twins’. It occurred to her that the study upstairs was always kept closed. She wondered what interesting things would be there. Books? Magazines? Perhaps... a beautiful painting? She couldn’t resist herself and started heading up the stairs. ① lonely → curious ② surprised → worried ③ indifferent → upset ④ comfortable → annoyed ⑤ disappointed → relieved 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? It’s unfortunate that when something goes wrong, people obsess about why it happened, whose fault it was, and “why me?” Honestly, what good is that thinking in most cases? Train your brain to be solution­oriented. Let’s take the simplest example on the planet. What happens when a glass of milk spills? Yes, you can obsess and say, how did that fall, who made it fall, will it stain the floor, or think something along the lines of, “Why always me? I’m in a hurry and don’t need this.” But someone with a solution­oriented thought process would simply get a towel, pick up the glass, and get a new glass of milk. Use your energy wisely; learn from mistakes but then move on fast with solutions. ① 문제가 생기면 주위 사람들에게 조언을 구하라. ② 비판하는 사람보다 격려하는 사람을 가까이하라. ③ 실패의 경험을 분석해서 배우려는 자세를 가져라. ④ 문제 자체에 집착하기보다는 문제 해결에 집중하라. ⑤ 예상치 못한 위험에 대비해 항상 경계를 늦추지 마라. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 live in the tightest echo chambers가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? What happens when students get the message that saying the wrong thing can get you in trouble? They do what one would expect: they talk to people they already agree with, keep their mouths shut about important topics in mixed company, and often don’t bother even arguing with the angriest or loudest person in the room. The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it? A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.” ① hear only the voices that strengthen their views ② have mixed feelings towards the academic world ③ find their followers from every corner of society ④ be responsive to emotional cues from their peers ⑤ blame educational systems for the social polarization 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Some company leaders say that their company is going through a lot of change and stress, which they “know” will lower their effectiveness, drive away top talent, and tear apart their teams. They need to think about the military, a place where stress and uncertainty are the status quo, and where employees are on­boarded not with a beach vacation but with boot camp. And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential. * status quo: 현 상태 ** boot camp: 신병 훈련소 ① 적절한 긴장감은 사고를 예방하는 데 도움이 된다. ② 신속함보다는 정확한 업무 처리가 생산성을 개선한다. ③ 목표 설정이 구체적일수록 성과를 빨리 달성할 수 있다. ④ 인적 자원에 대한 투자는 조직에 대한 충성심을 높인다. ⑤ 스트레스를 조직의 잠재력을 끌어낼 계기로 삼을 수 있다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Inspiration is a funny thing. It’s powerful enough to move mountains. When it strikes, it carries an author forward like the rushing torrents of a flooded river. And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created ― mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted ― by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner. This is the principle way writers finish 50,000 words of a novel each year during National Novel Writing Month ― by showing up ― and it applies to being creative the rest of the year as well. * torrent: 급류 ** saga: 대하소설 ① crucial roles of persistent effort in creative writing ② distinctive features of popular contemporary novels ③ importance of detailed description in writing fiction ④ revival of reading novels as a form of entertainment ⑤ classical literature as a timeless source of inspiration 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Hierarchies are good at weeding out obviously bad ideas. By the time an idea makes it all the way up the chain, it will have been compared to all the other ideas in the system, with the obviously good ideas ranked at the top. This seems like common sense. The problem is that obviously good ideas are not truly innovative, and truly innovative ideas often look like very bad ideas when they’re introduced. Western Union famously passed on the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents and technology for the telephone. At the time, phone calls were extremely noisy and easy to misinterpret, and they couldn’t span long distances, and Western Union knew from its telegram business that profitable communication depended on accuracy and widespread reach. And Wikipedia was considered a joke when it started. How could something written by a crowd replace the work of the world’s top scholars? Today it is so much more comprehensive than anything that came before it that it’s widely considered the only encyclopedia. ① When Innovation Turns into Disappointment ② Why We Are Attracted to Daring Innovation ③ How Hierarchies Miss Out on Innovative Ideas ④ Collective Intelligence: A Tool for Breakthroughs ⑤ Patents: Fundamental Assets for Innovative Firms 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

They need to think about the military, a place where stress and uncertainty are the status quo, and where employees are on­boarded not with a beach vacation but with boot camp. And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential.* status quo: 현 상태  ** boot camp: 신병 훈련소① 적절한 긴장감은 사고를 예방하는 데 도움이 된다.② 신속함보다는 정확한 업무 처리가 생산성을 개선한다.③ 목표 설정이 구체적일수록 성과를 빨리 달성할 수 있다.④ 인적 자원에 대한 투자는 조직에 대한 충성심을 높인다.⑤ 스트레스를 조직의 잠재력을 끌어낼 계기로 삼을 수 있다."

When it strikes, it carries an author forward like the rushing torrents of a flooded river. And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created ― mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted ― by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner. This is the principle way writers finish 50,000 words of a novel each year during National Novel Writing Month ― by showing up ― and it applies to being creative the rest of the year as well.* torrent: 급류  ** saga: 대하소설① crucial roles of persistent effort in creative writing② distinctive features of popular contemporary novels③ importance of detailed description in writing fiction④ revival of reading novels as a form of entertainment⑤ classical literature as a timeless source of inspiration"

By the time an idea makes it all the way up the chain, it will have been compared to all the other ideas in the system, with the obviously good ideas ranked at the top. This seems like common sense. The problem is that obviously good ideas are not truly innovative, and truly innovative ideas often look like very bad ideas when they’re introduced. Western Union famously passed on the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents and technology for the telephone. At the time, phone calls were extremely noisy and easy to misinterpret, and they couldn’t span long distances, and Western Union knew from its telegram business that profitable communication depended on accuracy and widespread reach. And Wikipedia was considered a joke when it started. How could something written by a crowd replace the work of the world’s top scholars?

Apgar tried something new, focusing her efforts on anesthesiology. After being denied several times, she was accepted into a training program in anesthesiology. As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies. During this time, she developed the Apgar score, which is a method of checking the health of a newborn. According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies. She received many awards including an honorary doctorate from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1964. In 1973, she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the Ladies Home Journal.* anesthesiology: 마취학① 의과 대학 졸업 후 외과에서 인턴 과정을 마쳤다.② 단번에 마취학 훈련 과정 입학을 허가받았다. ③ 산모 마취가 아기에게 미치는 영향에 관심을 가졌다.④ 신생아의 건강을 확인하는 방법을 개발했다.⑤ 명예박사 학위를 포함하여 많은 상을 받았다."

Knowing who an author is and what his or her likely intentions are in creating text or artwork is tremendously important to most of us. Not knowing who wrote, or created, some artwork is often very frustrating. Our culture places great worth on the identity of speakers, writers, and artists. Perhaps the single most important aspect of “authorship” is the vaguely apprehended presence of human creativity, personality, and authority that nominal authorship seems to provide. It is almost unthinkable for a visitor to an art museum to admire a roomful of paintings without knowing the names of the individual painters, or for a reader not to know who the writer is of the novel she is reading.

All athletes have an innate preference for task­ or ego­involved goals in sport. These predispositions, referred to as task and ego goal orientations, are believed to develop throughout childhood largely due to the types of people the athletes come in contact with and the situations they are placed in. If children consistently receive parental praise depending on their effort and recognition for personal improvement from their coaches, and are encouraged to learn from their mistakes, then they are likely to foster a task orientation. It becomes natural for them to believe that success is associated with mastery, effort, understanding, and personal responsibility. The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non­selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition. This kind of environment helps an ego orientation to flourish, along with the belief that . * predisposition: 성향 ①not the result but the process is what matters most ②an athlete’s abilities will blossom with image training ③cooperation, rather than competition, builds up a team ④ability and talent, not effort and personal endeavor, earn success ⑤the athletes’ peers, not the coaches, are the true judge of their performance 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?

Historians and sociologists of science have recently corrected this claim by showing how senses other than seeing, including listening, have been significant in the development of knowledge, notable in the laboratory. If there is any field that is associated with seeing rather than with hearing, it is science. Scholars who emphasize the visual bias in Western culture even point to science as their favorite example. ( ①) Because doing research seems impossible without using images, graphs, and diagrams, science is ― in their view ― a visual endeavor par excellence.

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) Bernard Farrelly was one of the greatest of Australian surfers in history. In 1964, he became the first non­Hawaiian to win a major surfing contest at Makaha beach, Hawaii. After more than forty years, by then fairly forgotten in this part of the world, (a) he happened to be passing through Hawaii with his wife, and decided to go back to the beach for a look. (B) But the other surfer soon paddled over. “Hey, Bernard,” he said, by way of greeting, in his thick Hawaiian accent. The Hawaiian remembered (b) him, and they talked of times past. They talked of Bernard’s winning in Makaha, of the beautiful waves in Hawaii, of what had happened in the beach since. This, Farrelly was thinking, is the real Hawaii experience, not the stuff on the shore. (C) “Hey, Bernard,” the man spoke again as there came a big wave, and he moved his own board well out of the way, “you take this wave.” It was classic Hawaiian culture, where giving what you have is always the first order of things. Farrelly thanked him and farewelled (c) him at the moment the swell rose to a roaring beauty. With the setting sun, he was surfing his way back to his wife. “That,” he told her, “was the perfect wave.” (D) Things on the beachfront had changed a lot. The beach and surf, however, were as pure and magical as ever, so (d) he was eager to ride on the Hawaiian surf once again. While his wife stayed in the car, Farrelly took his board out. The further out he got, the more freedom he felt. In the gathering dusk, just one other surfer was there, a large native Hawaiian. Farrelly, an Australian visitor to these shores, kept (e) his distance. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글의 Bernard Farrelly에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① 하와이의 서핑 대회에서 우승한 적이 있었다. ② 그를 기억하는 하와이 원주민 서퍼를 만났다. ③ 하와이 문화에 따라 큰 파도를 동료에게 양보했다. ④ 해 질 무렵에 파도를 탔다. ⑤ 아내를 차에 둔 채 파도를 타러 갔다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오.
