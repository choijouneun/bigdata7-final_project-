The assignments she completed were excellent, and demonstrated a thorough understanding of contract law. She also has remarkable energy and interpersonal skills. She represents her class on the law school’s student council and has taken on this responsibility with spirit, interacting with students effectively. I support her application wholeheartedly.

Thank you. I’ll check it out now.” Jerry Shaw hung up with a smile on his face. Humming, he headed to the bank to withdraw some cash. He stopped at the ATM, inserted the card and entered his PIN. The screen flashed the message, “Card not valid ―please see a teller.” What? My bonus was deposited just now! Entering the bank, Jerry told the teller what had happened. She studied the screen and frowned. “Mr. Shaw, your account was closed. All your funds were withdrawn when you closed it,” she said. “What do you mean? I never did! It must be identity theft!” yelled Jerry, his voice barely under control. ①delighted →panicked ②anxious →envious ③sympathetic →exhausted ④grateful →indifferent ⑤confused →enthusiastic 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Anthropology has become relevant for addressing global issues. This is not to deny the vital role of ‘hard’ sciences in addressing these problems. However, if we are to solve global problems we need a new way of thinking based in humanities and social sciences. It is impossible to resolve global issues merely by looking at numbers and statistics. Anthropology thus becomes crucial, as a discipline and a profession enabling the collection and interpretation of ‘thick data’ ― in addition to ‘big data’ ― and helps us to understand the world we live in more comprehensively. Why is a brand new and expensive ‘smart’ building a disaster? What will happen in the future with passenger cars? In answering such questions, we should stop relying only on quantitative data analytics; instead, the most important decisions should also be informed by anthropological qualitative approaches which provide a more complete and nuanced picture of people’s lives. ①광범위한 규모의 문제를 다룰 때는 처리 단계를 세분화해야 한다. ②실증적 자료를 토대로 해결할 수 있는 문제를 먼저 처리해야 한다. ③글로벌 문제 해결을 위해 인류학의 질적 접근법을 활용해야 한다. ④전 인류적 문제에 대한 질적 연구는 정량화된 수치에 기반해야 한다. ⑤사회 문제의 포괄적 이해를 위해 자료를 반복적으로 검증해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Our brains light up when our predicted reality and actual reality match. Our brains love to be right. We also don’t like to be wrong, and we feel threatened when our stereotyped predictions don’t come true. Psychologist Wendy Mendes asked White and Asian college students to interact with Latino students who had been hired as actors by the researchers. Some of the Latino students portrayed themselves as socioeconomically “high status,” with lawyer fathers, professor mothers, and summers spent volunteering in Europe. Others portrayed themselves as “low status,” with unemployed parents and part-time summer jobs. The researchers found that when participants interacted with the Latino students who appeared to come from wealth and thus challenged American stereotypes, they responded physiologically as if to a threat: their blood vessels constricted and their heart activity changed. In these interactions, participants also saw the students who violated stereotypes as less likable. In this way, stereotypes that are descriptive can easily become prescriptive. The phenomenon, it turns out, may have a neuroscientific explanation: it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system. ①Our brain prefers actual reality to predicted reality. ②Humans have a tendency to deny that they are stereotyped. ③Humans are conditioned to avoid people who resemble them. ④Our brain dislikes when something goes against its prediction. ⑤When dissatisfied, the brain operates to make itself feel better. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? We can imagine natural numbers as whole objects, things our hunter-gatherer brains can work with. On the other hand, partial numbers ― decimals, fractions, percentages, and ratios ― simply don’t register as real to our minds. We may be able to work with them for a given time when we’re in math mode, but if we’re asked questions at other times, we tend to have trouble grasping the concept. In other words, any time we give our audience figures that aren’t natural numbers, the message is unlikely to make sense to them. Not only are they prone to make errors remembering and calculating the numbers, but there’s a good chance they never even envision what we’re describing in the first place ― because the number attached isn’t solid. Use natural numbers whenever you can to make your message real. For numbers less than 1, you can use a strategy to make things start to show up as natural numbers. If you find that 0.2% of people have a certain trait, using “1 out of 500” makes this abstract percentage into a real thing. ①근사치를 사용하면 정보를 신속하게 처리할 수 있다. ②복잡한 계산에서 단위를 통일하는 것이 혼동을 방지한다. ③수학 기호의 사용이 효과적인 정보 전달을 가능하게 한다. ④자연수로 수치가 표현될 때 메시지가 실재적으로 전달된다. ⑤메시지에 소수 표현을 포함하는 것은 내용의 신뢰도를 높여 준다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Facing large-scale, long-term change can seem overwhelming. Problems like global contagion or economic inequality are so complex that it can be hard to believe any intervention might make a difference. Working through fears of what could be depends on connecting with the abstract. Linking issues like climate change, for example, with the realities of our own neighborhoods, jobs, and relationships, translates conceptual ideas into concrete emotions. Thinking of how the beaches we love might disappear, how more frequent floods might destroy our homes, or how we might have to move to flee mounting wildfire risk, evokes feelings like anger, sadness, or guilt ― feelings that inspire us to act. A recent study found that when people feel personally affected by potential climatic change, they are more likely to support carbon reduction efforts and push for proactive policies. Forming emotional connections to potential futures helps us move from denial and despair to action. ①effectiveness of making remote problems personal ②impacts of negative tone in news on problem solving ③contribution of experts to solving large-scale problems ④limits of personal intervention in minimizing climate change ⑤risks of attempting to predict events with limited information 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? There was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. They were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. * discrepancy: 불일치 ①The Difficulty of Proving the Gravitational Law ②An Illusion Created by the Shadow of the Moon ③Why Aren’t Jupiter’s Moons Observed Where They Should Be? ④Obstacles in Measuring Light’s Speed: Limits of Past Technology ⑤Ahead and Behind: Moons Change Their Position by Themselves 4 영어 영역 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Josef Frank에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Josef Frank, born in Austria of Jewish heritage, studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. He then taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 to 1925. He founded an interior design firm together with some architect colleagues in 1925. He was one of early Vienna modernism’s most important figures, but already in the beginning of the 1920s he started to question modernism’s growing pragmatism. He had little appreciation for the French architect Le Corbusier’s belief that a house should be “a machine for living in.” He was against the standardized interior design trend of the time, fearing that it would make people all too uniform. He moved to Sweden with his Swedish wife in 1933 to escape growing Nazi discrimination and gained citizenship in 1939. He was the most prestigious designer at his Stockholm design company. In addition to his architectural work he created numerous designs for furniture, fabric, wallpaper and carpet. * pragmatism: 실용주의 ①Vienna University of Technology에서 건축학을 공부했다. ②건축가 동료들과 함께 인테리어 디자인 회사를 설립했다. ③초기 비엔나 모더니즘의 가장 중요한 인물 중 한 명이었다. ④당시의 표준화된 인테리어 디자인 경향을 옹호했다. ⑤나치의 차별을 피해 스웨덴으로 가서 시민권을 얻었다. 27. 2023 Idea Sharing Contest에 관한 다음 안내문의 내용과 일치 하지 않는 것은? 2023 Idea Sharing Contest Do you have any ideas that we can practice in our daily lives for carbon neutrality?

Population with Dementia in Six European Countries per 1,000 Inhabitants Italy Providing feedback to students is a critical task of teachers.

How do hormones trigger reactions in the body? When a hormone is released from a gland, it travels in the bloodstream through the body in search of its ①target. Organs, tissues and other glands in the body have receptor sites that hormones must bind to in order to deliver their message and cause an effect. But because every hormone has its own unique shape, they are designed to act only on the parts of the body that have a receptor site with the ②corresponding shape. This mode of action can be likened to a lock and key mechanism ― if the key doesn’t fit the lock, then nothing will happen. When a hormone binds to its receptor, it sets off a chain of other signaling pathways to create a ③change in the body. Once the desired effect has taken place and there is too much hormone circulating in the blood, this signal is fed back to the glands to ④boost further hormone release. This is called a feedback loop and, when functioning correctly, it allows the endocrine system to ⑤ensure the conditions in your body remain in balance. * gland: (분비)선 ** endocrine system: 내분비계",

Anthropology has become relevant for addressing global issues. This is not to deny the vital role of ‘hard’ sciences in addressing these problems. However, if we are to solve global problems we need a new way of thinking based in humanities and social sciences. It is impossible to resolve global issues merely by looking at numbers and statistics. Anthropology thus becomes crucial, as a discipline and a profession enabling the collection and interpretation of ‘thick data’ ― in addition to ‘big data’ ― and helps us to understand the world we live in more comprehensively. Why is a brand new and expensive ‘smart’ building a disaster? What will happen in the future with passenger cars? In answering such questions, we should stop relying only on quantitative data analytics; instead, the most important decisions should also be informed by anthropological qualitative approaches which provide a more complete and nuanced picture of people’s lives. ①광범위한 규모의 문제를 다룰 때는 처리 단계를 세분화해야 한다. ②실증적 자료를 토대로 해결할 수 있는 문제를 먼저 처리해야 한다. ③글로벌 문제 해결을 위해 인류학의 질적 접근법을 활용해야 한다. ④전 인류적 문제에 대한 질적 연구는 정량화된 수치에 기반해야 한다. ⑤사회 문제의 포괄적 이해를 위해 자료를 반복적으로 검증해야 한다. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Our brains light up when our predicted reality and actual reality match. Our brains love to be right. We also don’t like to be wrong, and we feel threatened when our stereotyped predictions don’t come true. Psychologist Wendy Mendes asked White and Asian college students to interact with Latino students who had been hired as actors by the researchers. Some of the Latino students portrayed themselves as socioeconomically “high status,” with lawyer fathers, professor mothers, and summers spent volunteering in Europe. Others portrayed themselves as “low status,” with unemployed parents and part-time summer jobs. The researchers found that when participants interacted with the Latino students who appeared to come from wealth and thus challenged American stereotypes, they responded physiologically as if to a threat: their blood vessels constricted and their heart activity changed. In these interactions, participants also saw the students who violated stereotypes as less likable. In this way, stereotypes that are descriptive can easily become prescriptive. The phenomenon, it turns out, may have a neuroscientific explanation: it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system. ①Our brain prefers actual reality to predicted reality. ②Humans have a tendency to deny that they are stereotyped. ③Humans are conditioned to avoid people who resemble them. ④Our brain dislikes when something goes against its prediction. ⑤When dissatisfied, the brain operates to make itself feel better. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? We can imagine natural numbers as whole objects, things our hunter-gatherer brains can work with. On the other hand, partial numbers ― decimals, fractions, percentages, and ratios ― simply don’t register as real to our minds. We may be able to work with them for a given time when we’re in math mode, but if we’re asked questions at other times, we tend to have trouble grasping the concept. In other words, any time we give our audience figures that aren’t natural numbers, the message is unlikely to make sense to them. Not only are they prone to make errors remembering and calculating the numbers, but there’s a good chance they never even envision what we’re describing in the first place ― because the number attached isn’t solid. Use natural numbers whenever you can to make your message real. For numbers less than 1, you can use a strategy to make things start to show up as natural numbers. If you find that 0.2% of people have a certain trait, using “1 out of 500” makes this abstract percentage into a real thing. ①근사치를 사용하면 정보를 신속하게 처리할 수 있다. ②복잡한 계산에서 단위를 통일하는 것이 혼동을 방지한다. ③수학 기호의 사용이 효과적인 정보 전달을 가능하게 한다. ④자연수로 수치가 표현될 때 메시지가 실재적으로 전달된다. ⑤메시지에 소수 표현을 포함하는 것은 내용의 신뢰도를 높여 준다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Facing large-scale, long-term change can seem overwhelming. Problems like global contagion or economic inequality are so complex that it can be hard to believe any intervention might make a difference. Working through fears of what could be depends on connecting with the abstract. Linking issues like climate change, for example, with the realities of our own neighborhoods, jobs, and relationships, translates conceptual ideas into concrete emotions. Thinking of how the beaches we love might disappear, how more frequent floods might destroy our homes, or how we might have to move to flee mounting wildfire risk, evokes feelings like anger, sadness, or guilt ― feelings that inspire us to act. A recent study found that when people feel personally affected by potential climatic change, they are more likely to support carbon reduction efforts and push for proactive policies. Forming emotional connections to potential futures helps us move from denial and despair to action. ①effectiveness of making remote problems personal ②impacts of negative tone in news on problem solving ③contribution of experts to solving large-scale problems ④limits of personal intervention in minimizing climate change ⑤risks of attempting to predict events with limited information 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? There was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. They were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more.

On the other hand, partial numbers ― decimals, fractions, percentages, and ratios― simply don’t register as real to our minds. We may be able to work with them for a given time when we’re in math mode, but if we’re asked questions at other times, we tend to have trouble grasping the concept. In other words, any time we give our audience figures that aren’t natural numbers, the message is unlikely to make sense to them. Not only are they prone to make errors remembering and calculating the numbers, but there’s a good chance they never even envision what we’re describing in the first place ― because the number attached isn’t solid. Use natural numbers whenever you can to make your message real. For numbers less than 1, you can use a strategy to make things start to show up as natural numbers. If you find that 0.2% of people have a certain trait, using “1 out of 500” makes this abstract percentage into a real thing.①근사치를 사용하면 정보를 신속하게 처리할 수 있다.②복잡한 계산에서 단위를 통일하는 것이 혼동을 방지한다.③수학 기호의 사용이 효과적인 정보 전달을 가능하게 한다.④자연수로 수치가 표현될 때 메시지가 실재적으로 전달된다.⑤메시지에 소수 표현을 포함하는 것은 내용의 신뢰도를 높여 준다."

Problems like global contagion or economic inequality are so complex that it can be hard to believe any intervention might make a difference. Working through fears of what could be depends on connecting with the abstract. Linking issues like climate change, for example, with the realities of our own neighborhoods, jobs, and relationships, translates conceptual ideas into concrete emotions. Thinking of how the beaches we love might disappear, how more frequent floods might destroy our homes, or how we might have to move to flee mounting wildfire risk, evokes feelings like anger, sadness, or guilt ―feelings that inspire us to act. A recent study found that when people feel personally affected by potential climatic change, they are more likely to support carbon reduction efforts and push for proactive policies. Forming emotional connections to potential futures helps us move from denial and despair to action.①effectiveness of making remote problems personal②impacts of negative tone in news on problem solving③contribution of experts to solving large-scale problems④limits of personal intervention in minimizing climate change⑤risks of attempting to predict events with limited information"

These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. They were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.* discrepancy: 불일치①The Difficulty of Proving the Gravitational Law②An Illusion Created by the Shadow of the Moon③Why Aren’t Jupiter’s Moons Observed Where They Should Be?④Obstacles in Measuring Light’s Speed: Limits of Past Technology⑤Ahead and Behind: Moons Change Their Position by Themselves4영어 영역48"

Animals arguably make art. The male bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia dedicate huge fractions of their time and energy to creating elaborate structures from twigs, flowers, berries, beetle wings, and even colorful trash. These are the backdrops to their complex mating dances, which include acrobatic moves and even imitations of other species. What’s most amazing about the towers and “bowers” they construct is that they aren’t stereotyped like a beehive or hummingbird nest. Each one is different. Artistic skill, along with fine craftsbirdship, is rewarded by the females. Many researchers suggest these displays are used by the females to gauge the cognitive abilities of her potential mates, but Darwin thought that she was actually attracted to their beauty. In other words, the bowers ; they are appreciated by the females for their own sake, much as we appreciate a painting or a bouquet of spring flowers.

Running a business that sells goods and services to consumers requires getting to know the products they like. More than that, however, you want to . In traditional or online sales, people are bound to favorably regard the vendor and product that they could easily inquire about and quickly acquire in good order.

In Hegel’s philosophy, even though there is interaction and interrelation between the universal and the individual, . For Hegel, individuals are not distinguished in terms of Reason. In Philosophy of Right Hegel stresses particularity and universality as follows: “A man, who acts perversely, exhibits particularity. The rational is the highway on which everyone travels, and no one is specially marked.” Here, Hegel maintains that individuals can be differentiated from each other in terms of their acts but they are not differentiated with respect to reason. There are specific thoughts, but they are finally resolved into the universal. One might say that Hegel seems to focus on the individual like Aristotle but in reality, he subtly treats the universal as fundamental whereas Aristotle considers the individual as primary substance and universal as secondary substance; in so doing Aristotle emphasizes the universal to be subordinate to the individual in contrast to Hegel. * perversely: 별나게 ①an individual stands alone apart from the universe ②the universal still has more priority than the individual ③universal truth cannot be the key to individual problems ④individuals can’t deduce universal principles from reality itself ⑤every individual should have his or her own particular universe 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? One of the branches of postmodernism examines the structure of language and how it is used. It challenges the assumption that language can be precisely used to represent reality. ①Meanings of words are ambiguous, as words are only signs or labels given to concepts (what is signified) and therefore there is no necessary correspondence between the word and the meaning, the signifier and the signified. ②The use of signs (words) and their meaning can vary depending on the flow of the text in which they are used, leading to the possibility of ‘deconstructing’ text to reveal its underlying inconsistencies. ③Reality exists outside of our thoughts, and it is only through language that we are able to perceive the natural world as it really is. ④This approach can be applied to all forms of representation ― pictures, films, etc. that gain added or alternative meanings by the overlaying of references to previous uses. ⑤This can be seen particularly in the media, where it is difficult to distinguish the real from the unreal ― everything is representation, there is no reality.",

Imperializing cultures produce great works of art (great representations) which can be put to work intellectually as armies and trading houses work militarily and economically.(A) That is because unless we can control the world intellectually by maps we cannot control it militarily or economically. Mercator, Molière, Columbus and Captain Cook imperialized in different ways, but they all imperialized, and ultimately the effectiveness of one depended upon and supported the effectiveness of all the others.(B) Similarly the US form of contemporary colonization, which involves occupying economies and political parties rather than physical territories, is accompanied by the power of both Hollywood and the satellite to represent the world to and for the US.(C) Shakespeare, Jane Austen and maps were as important to English Imperial power as was the East India Company, the British army and the churches of England. It is no coincidence that modern Europe, the Europe of colonization, was also the Europe of “great art,” and no coincidence either that it was the Europe of great map makers.

        "지문": "다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) There were two neighbors living next to each other. One was a professor and the other was a merchant who had an unmotivated son. Both of them had planted the same kind of plant in each of their gardens. The professor gave a small amount of water to his plants and didn’t always give his full attention to them. Meanwhile, in the merchant’s garden, the merchant gave a lot of water to (a) his plants and looked after them well. (B) The merchant was surprised to see this because he thought he had given his plants better care than the professor. He went to his neighbor and said, “Only (b) my plants came out from the roots. How is that possible?” The professor smiled and said, “You gave your plants so much attention and water that they didn’t need to work for themselves.” “Is that really a problem?” said the merchant with a curious look on (c) his face. (C) The professor continued his explanation, “I gave my plants just an adequate amount of water and let their roots search for more. Their roots went deeper and grew stronger.” At that moment, the merchant recalled the image of (d) his son, still lazy and dependent on his parents. “Is that how you approach teaching?” asked the merchant. The professor said, “Yes. Students are like plants. Sometimes guiding is better than giving.” Nodding silently, the merchant began to rethink what education is. (D) The professor’s plants were simple but looked good, while the merchant’s plants were much fuller and greener. One night, there was a heavy storm. After the storm was over, both of the neighbors inspected the damage to their gardens. The merchant saw that his plants had come out from the roots and were totally destroyed by the storm. But, the plants of (e) his neighbor were not damaged at all and were standing firm. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ①(B) - (D) - (C) ②(C) - (B) - (D) ③(C) - (D) - (B) ④(D) - (B) - (C) ⑤(D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ①(a) ②(b) ③(c) ④(d) ⑤(e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ①교수와 상인은 각자의 정원에 같은 종류의 식물을 심었다. ②상인은 자신이 교수보다 식물을 더 잘 보살폈다고 생각했다. ③교수는 학생들이 식물과 같다고 말했다. ④상인은 교육이 무엇인지 다시 생각해 보기 시작했다. ⑤상인의 식물은 폭풍으로 인한 손상을 입지 않았다. ※ 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인 하시오.",
