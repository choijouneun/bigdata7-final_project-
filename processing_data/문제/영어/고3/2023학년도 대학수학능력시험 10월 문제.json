I hurried to the bus terminal to return home for Christmas. As soon as I arrived at the terminal, I saw my bus pulling away. I called out and ran after the bus, but it was too late. I felt a wave of disappointment wash over me as I realized that I would have to wait three hours for the next bus. I must have been visibly upset because a woman came over, took my arm, and led me to the street. She called a taxi and gave the driver a five­dollar bill. She told him to take me to the ferry terminal, because the bus made a stop there before heading out onto the highway. She also wished me a Merry Christmas, and all I could do was smile. I couldn’t believe what she had done for me, a complete stranger! ① frustrated → touched ② jealous → proud ③ thrilled → doubtful ④ calm → regretful ⑤ indifferent → sympathetic 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? The chemists Hans Ebel, Claus Bliefert, and William Russey note: “It goes without saying that scientists need to be skillful readers. Extensive reading is the principal key to expanding one’s knowledge and keeping up with developments in a discipline. However, what is often overlooked here is that scientists are also obliged to be skillful writers. Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading. It would be beneficial for them to understand how readers read in order to improve their writing. ① 과학자는 독자와 만나는 기회를 자주 가져야 한다. ② 과학자는 독자의 관점에서 글을 쓸 줄 알아야 한다. ③ 과학자는 다양한 의견에 개방적인 태도를 가져야 한다. ④ 과학자는 자기 연구 분야 이외의 책도 많이 읽어야 한다. ⑤ 과학자는 연구 결과가 사회에 미치는 영향을 인식해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 squeeze economies into a test tube가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Physicians and other natural scientists test their theories using controlled experiments. Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing. As Nobel Prize­winning physicist Murray Gell­Mann once observed, “Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.” * serendipitous: 우연히 발견하는 ① admit economists’ contributions to the natural sciences ② conduct controlled experiments on the economy ③ employ complex economic theories ④ share test results with other scientists ⑤ collect economic data over a long period of time 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Imagine a movie where nothing but terrible things happen. But, in the end, everything works out. Everything is resolved. A sufficiently happy ending can change the meaning of all the previous events. They can all be viewed as worthwhile, given that ending. Now imagine another movie. A lot of things are happening. They’re all exciting and interesting. But there are a lot of them. Ninety minutes in, you start to worry. “This is a great movie,” you think, “but there are a lot of things going on. I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it all together.” But that doesn’t happen. Instead, the story ends, suddenly, unresolved, or something facile and clichéd occurs. You leave deeply annoyed and unsatisfied — failing to notice that you were fully engaged and enjoying the movie almost the whole time you were in the theatre. The present can change the past, and the future can change the present. * facile: 지나치게 단순한 ** clichéd: 상투적인 ① 결말에 따라 이전 상황에 대한 인식이 달라진다. ② 익숙하지 않은 이야기는 대중의 사랑을 받기 어렵다. ③ 흥행에 성공한 영화가 항상 작품성이 뛰어난 것은 아니다. ④ 상황에 대한 집단의 평가는 개인의 평가에 영향을 끼친다. ⑤ 같은 영화를 반복적으로 보는 것이 영화에 대한 이해를 높인다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Just as today some jobs are better than others, so would they have been in early societies with their blossoming towns and eventually cities, with some roles more dangerous and some having more plentiful access to food or other resources. The archeological record shows that soon after the appearance of towns, agriculture, and surpluses, some burials start to look different from others. Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well — chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors. Early on these differences are small, but by 5,000 to 7,000 years ago they are becoming quite pronounced. * archeological: 고고학의 ** surplus: 잉여물 *** isotope: 동위 원소 ① the evidence of social inequality found in ancient burials ② scientific efforts to preserve ancient remains ③ attempts to overcome inequality in history ④ cultural differences in the concept of better jobs ⑤ ancient agricultural methods passed down to the present 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? When you break up with a partner or close friend, the natural response (after having a good cry, obviously) is to blame yourself. You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn’t have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential.

Ann Bancroft에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Ann Bancroft was born in Minnesota, U.S. Bancroft grew up in rural Minnesota in what she described as a family of risk­takers. Although she struggled with a learning disability, she graduated from St. Paul Academy and became a physical education teacher. Bancroft resigned her teaching position in 1986 in order to participate in the Will Steger International Polar Expedition. The group departed from Ellesmere Island on March 6, and after 56 days, she and five other team members arrived at the North Pole by dogsled. She thus became the first woman to reach the North Pole by sled and on foot. In November 1992, she led three other women on the American Women’s Expedition to Antarctica. It took them 67 days to reach the South Pole on skis and Bancroft became the first woman to have stood at both poles. ① Minnesota의 시골에서 자랐다. ② St. Paul Academy를 졸업하고 체육 교사가 되었다. ③ 1986년에 교직을 그만두었다. ④ Ellesmere섬에서 출발한 지 56일 후에 북극에 도달했다. ⑤ 세 명의 남자 대원과 남극까지 스키를 타고 갔다. 27. 2023 Greenfield City Run에 관한 다음 안내문의 내용과 일치 하지 않는 것은? 2023 Greenfield City Run Are you eager for the race that can awaken the running spirit within you?

Dr. Joseph Bell was a professor of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. His students were amazed by his astonishing powers of observation. He seemed able to determine what patients did for a living, or what illness ①they might have, simply by glancing in their direction. One time he concluded that a patient ②had walked across a golf course on the way to the doctor, simply by looking at his shoes. One of Bell’s students was particularly impressed with his teacher’s abilities. He filled up notebooks with examples of ③what he called Bell’s “eerie trick of spotting details.” The student eventually went into practice himself outside London. When business was slow he filled his spare moments by writing stories. He took Dr. Bell’s powers of perception, and gave them to a character of his own making — a character who made the young doctor, Arthur Conan Doyle, ④famous around the world.

I hurried to the bus terminal to return home for Christmas. As soon as I arrived at the terminal, I saw my bus pulling away. I called out and ran after the bus, but it was too late. I felt a wave of disappointment wash over me as I realized that I would have to wait three hours for the next bus. I must have been visibly upset because a woman came over, took my arm, and led me to the street. She called a taxi and gave the driver a five­dollar bill. She told him to take me to the ferry terminal, because the bus made a stop there before heading out onto the highway. She also wished me a Merry Christmas, and all I could do was smile. I couldn’t believe what she had done for me, a complete stranger! ① frustrated → touched ② jealous → proud ③ thrilled → doubtful ④ calm → regretful ⑤ indifferent → sympathetic 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? The chemists Hans Ebel, Claus Bliefert, and William Russey note: “It goes without saying that scientists need to be skillful readers. Extensive reading is the principal key to expanding one’s knowledge and keeping up with developments in a discipline. However, what is often overlooked here is that scientists are also obliged to be skillful writers. Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading. It would be beneficial for them to understand how readers read in order to improve their writing. ① 과학자는 독자와 만나는 기회를 자주 가져야 한다. ② 과학자는 독자의 관점에서 글을 쓸 줄 알아야 한다. ③ 과학자는 다양한 의견에 개방적인 태도를 가져야 한다. ④ 과학자는 자기 연구 분야 이외의 책도 많이 읽어야 한다. ⑤ 과학자는 연구 결과가 사회에 미치는 영향을 인식해야 한다. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 squeeze economies into a test tube가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Physicians and other natural scientists test their theories using controlled experiments. Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing. As Nobel Prize­winning physicist Murray Gell­Mann once observed, “Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.” * serendipitous: 우연히 발견하는 ① admit economists’ contributions to the natural sciences ② conduct controlled experiments on the economy ③ employ complex economic theories ④ share test results with other scientists ⑤ collect economic data over a long period of time 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Imagine a movie where nothing but terrible things happen. But, in the end, everything works out. Everything is resolved. A sufficiently happy ending can change the meaning of all the previous events. They can all be viewed as worthwhile, given that ending. Now imagine another movie. A lot of things are happening. They’re all exciting and interesting. But there are a lot of them. Ninety minutes in, you start to worry. “This is a great movie,” you think, “but there are a lot of things going on. I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it all together.” But that doesn’t happen. Instead, the story ends, suddenly, unresolved, or something facile and clichéd occurs. You leave deeply annoyed and unsatisfied — failing to notice that you were fully engaged and enjoying the movie almost the whole time you were in the theatre. The present can change the past, and the future can change the present. * facile: 지나치게 단순한 ** clichéd: 상투적인 ① 결말에 따라 이전 상황에 대한 인식이 달라진다. ② 익숙하지 않은 이야기는 대중의 사랑을 받기 어렵다. ③ 흥행에 성공한 영화가 항상 작품성이 뛰어난 것은 아니다. ④ 상황에 대한 집단의 평가는 개인의 평가에 영향을 끼친다. ⑤ 같은 영화를 반복적으로 보는 것이 영화에 대한 이해를 높인다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Just as today some jobs are better than others, so would they have been in early societies with their blossoming towns and eventually cities, with some roles more dangerous and some having more plentiful access to food or other resources. The archeological record shows that soon after the appearance of towns, agriculture, and surpluses, some burials start to look different from others. Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well — chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors. Early on these differences are small, but by 5,000 to 7,000 years ago they are becoming quite pronounced. * archeological: 고고학의 ** surplus: 잉여물 *** isotope: 동위 원소 ① the evidence of social inequality found in ancient burials ② scientific efforts to preserve ancient remains ③ attempts to overcome inequality in history ④ cultural differences in the concept of better jobs ⑤ ancient agricultural methods passed down to the present 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? When you break up with a partner or close friend, the natural response (after having a good cry, obviously) is to blame yourself. You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn’t have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential. The same is true for us as humans. It might take a cup of warm milk to reset us and give us comfort after a relationship has broken down. But however many bonds we see come apart, we will always retain one of our most human abilities: to connect afresh, find new friends and love again. ① Relationships: The Older, The Better ② A Break in a Bond: A New Beginning ③ Shared Experiences Make Strong Bonds ④ A Friend in Need, A Friend Indeed ⑤ Two Heads Are Better Than One 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing. As Nobel Prize­winning physicist Murray Gell­Mann once observed, “Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.”* serendipitous: 우연히 발견하는 ① admit economists’ contributions to the natural sciences② conduct controlled experiments on the economy③ employ complex economic theories④ share test results with other scientists⑤ collect economic data over a long period of time"

[3점]Just as today some jobs are better than others, so would they have been in early societies with their blossoming towns and eventually cities, with some roles more dangerous and some having more plentiful access to food or other resources. The archeological record shows that soon after the appearance of towns, agriculture, and surpluses, some burials start to look different from others. Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well — chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors. Early on these differences are small, but by 5,000 to 7,000 years ago they are becoming quite pronounced.* archeological: 고고학의  ** surplus: 잉여물  *** isotope: 동위 원소① the evidence of social inequality found in ancient burials② scientific efforts to preserve ancient remains③ attempts to overcome inequality in history④ cultural differences in the concept of better jobs⑤ ancient agricultural methods passed down to the present"

You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn’t have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential. The same is true for us as humans. It might take a cup of warm milk to reset us and give us comfort after a relationship has broken down.

The way we perceive the colors of the rainbow, and the universe in general, is influenced by the words we use to describe them. This is not limited to visual perception but also applies to smell, taste, touch, our perception of time and countless other human experiences. A wine or Scotch connoisseur, for example, has a much richer vocabulary at their disposal to describe the fullness, finish, flavors and aroma of the drink, which in turn improves their ability to recognize and remember subtle differences of which a non­expert may be unaware. Similarly, a chef or perfumer has at their disposal labels for flavors and smells that allow them to perceive, differentiate among, prepare and remember subtle variations. The labels that we have at our disposal influence how we see the world around us. Regardless of where you place the limits of linguistic effects on cognition, there is evidence that at least some of the things that we perceive and remember differ depending on . * connoisseur: (예술품ㆍ음식ㆍ음악의) 감정가 ** cognition: 인식 ① where we purchase them ② how expensive they are ③ what labels we use ④ how persuasive ads are ⑤ who makes the products 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. A connection with ancestors, especially remote ones, is useful for getting a wide­angled, philosophical view of life. Whereas our immediate ancestors are notably skilled at helping us with the “little pictures,” namely the particular, the trees — say, a problem with a boss — our remote ones are best for seeing the “Big Picture,” namely the general, the forest — say, the meaning of our job. As modern people rush around blowing small problems out of proportion, thus contributing to a global anxiety epidemic, ancestral spirits have a broader perspective that can . When it comes to a trivial problem, for example, they’ll just tell us, “This too will pass.” They appreciate how rapidly and often things change. According to American anthropologist Richard Katz, for instance, Fijians say that from the ancestral viewpoint whatever looks unfortunate may turn out to be fortunate after all: “What may seem to be a horrible outcome ... is seen in another light by the ancestors.” The ancestors, it might be said, keep their heads when everyone around them is losing theirs. * epidemic: 확산 ** anthropologist: 인류학자 ① calm the disquieted soul ② boost cooperation in the community ③ make us stick to the specific details ④ result in a waste of time ⑤ complicate situations 34. One of the criticisms of Stoicism by modern translators and teachers is the amount of repetition. Marcus Aurelius, for example, has been dismissed by academics as not being original because his writing resembles that of other, earlier Stoics. This criticism misses the point. Even before Marcus’s time, Seneca was well aware that there was a lot of borrowing and overlap among the philosophers. That’s because real philosophers weren’t concerned with authorship, but only what worked. More important, they believed that what was said mattered less than what was done. And this is true now as it was then. You’re welcome to take all of the words of the great philosophers and use them to your own liking (they’re dead; they don’t mind). Feel free to make adjustments and improvements as you like. Adapt them to the real conditions of the real world. The way to prove that you truly understand what you speak and write, that you truly are original, is to . * Stoicism: 스토아 철학 ① put them into practice ② keep your writings to yourself ③ combine oral and written traditions ④ compare philosophical theories ⑤ avoid borrowing them 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Several common themes were found in the highly creative individuals regarding their early experiences and education. In early childhood their families accorded them a great deal of respect and allowed them to explore on their own and develop a strong sense of personal autonomy. ①There was also a lack of extreme emotional closeness with parents. ②There was little evidence of intensely negative experiences; for example there was, relative to the times in which they lived, very little physical punishment for transgressions. ③Nor, on the positive side, was there evidence of extremely intense bonds of the sort that can smother independence. ④There was more competition among brothers and sisters for parental love in nuclear families than in extended families. ⑤On balance, for those who would grow up to be highly creative, relationships with parents were relatively easy and, in later life, pleasant and friendly rather than intensely intimate. * autonomy: 자율성 ** transgression: 일탈 *** smother: 억누르다",

She had a strong desire to make a difference in the world, yet often felt that her efforts were insignificant. One day, Emily crossed paths with Martha, an elderly lady known for (a) her sour mood and tendency to keep to herself. Curiosity sparked within Emily, prompting her to initiate a conversation with Martha. (B) The event showcased the great works of many local artists, with a special surprise awaiting Martha. Emily had carefully prepared a section dedicated to Martha’s paintings, hoping to unveil it to her and the community. The day of the exhibition arrived, and the townspeople eagerly gathered, excited to witness the artistic wonders of their community. Emily anxiously awaited Martha’s arrival, wondering how Martha would react to the surprise (b) she had planned. Martha finally entered the exhibition hall, and her eyes filled with tears as she stood in front of her own artworks. (C) Martha slowly made her way through the section dedicated to (c) her paintings, examining each piece with a mix of nostalgia and longing. The crowd watched in silence, their hearts touched by Martha’s emotional response. As Martha reached the last painting, she turned to Emily with a bright smile, tears still shining in her eyes. “Emily, you’ve given me back a part of myself that I thought was lost forever,” Martha whispered, (d) her voice shaking with gratitude. “I had forgotten the joy that art once brought me, but you’ve reminded me of its power.” (D) Despite Martha’s initial resistance, Emily persistently reached out to her, sharing stories and expressing genuine interest in (e) her life. Through their conversations, Emily discovered that Martha had once been a famous painter. However, she had lost her passion for art due to personal hardships. Deeply moved by her sorrow, Emily resolved to help revive Martha’s creative spirit. So, she organized an art exhibition in the town’s community center. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① Emily는 호기심이 생겨 Martha와 대화를 시작하게 되었다. ② 미술 전시회에서는 Martha의 작품만 전시했다. ③ 마을 사람들은 Martha의 반응을 보고 마음이 뭉클했다. ④ Martha는 마지막 그림에 이르러 Emily를 향해 미소를 지었다. ⑤ Martha는 개인적인 역경 때문에 미술에 대한 열정을 잃었다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오.",
