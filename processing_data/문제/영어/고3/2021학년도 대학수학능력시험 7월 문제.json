I’m Maggie Morgan, a long­time fan of the Wakefield Community Theatre. I’m well aware that in this difficult economy, organisations such as the Wakefield Community Theatre are facing financial difficulties and therefore an increase in ticket prices is inevitable. But in my opinion, a 50 percent increase to the price of individual tickets seems totally unreasonable. It would mean that ordinary residents like myself will have fewer opportunities to enjoy a quality drama performance. Pricing tickets out of the range of local residents is not a good option, because it’ll hurt your organisation in years to come. I’m sure there will be other ways to get financial support instead of raising ticket prices so much. I hope to hear from you soon on this matter. ① 공연 관람권 가격 인상률에 이의를 제기하려고 ② 지역 주민을 위한 공연장 건립을 제안하려고 ③ 자선 연극 공연 개최에 감사하려고 ④ 공연 관람료의 단체 할인 가능 여부를 문의하려고 ⑤ 공연 취소로 입은 손실에 대해 보상을 요구하려고 19. 다음 글에 드러난 Tavil의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? Tavil feels he understands this buried world and he is ready to leave. But when he turns, the hole he’d climbed through no longer exists. In its place is a smooth wall of white tile, a continuation of the unending pattern throughout the tunnel. The broken scraps of debris that had littered the base of the hole are gone as well. And this is when he feels the horrifying truth of where he is: so deep underground that the climb down made the muscles in his legs and arms tremble. He is trapped. Brutally so. As if in a grave, in a tomb. Frightened, he claws at the tiles. He screams, not caring if someone hears; hoping they do and will cast him out. ① bored and lonely ② relieved and hopeful ③ thrilled and joyful ④ terrified and desperate ⑤ touched and grateful 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Your brain doesn’t recognize don’t. No matter what I say, don’t think of a giraffe with brown spots on it. No matter what I say, don’t think of a clear glass vase with fresh red roses in it. What happens? It’s automatic, isn’t it? Your brain goes ahead and creates the picture all by itself. Your words ― whether you think, say, read, or hear them ― are a direct command to create. The more direct the order, the more diligent the response. Trickily, if you say you don’t want to lose your temper, your brain doesn’t recognize don’t and sees it as a royal command to get you to lose your temper. If say you don’t want to spill your drink, it’s as good as an instruction to tip the contents. Change your words to support you. Create affirmations that suit you. Think and say precisely what you desire rather than what you don’t want. ① 원하는 바를 긍정문으로 생각하고 말하라. ② 창의력 향상을 위해 상상하는 연습을 하라. ③ 일상 대화 시 명령조의 말투를 사용하지 마라. ④ 자신이 하고 싶지 않은 일을 남에게 시키지 마라. ⑤ 기대했던 결과가 바로 나오지 않더라도 포기하지 마라. 고3 21. 밑줄 친 innovation is a delicate and vulnerable flower, easily crushed underfoot이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of innovation is how unpopular it is, for all the lip service we pay to it. Despite the abundant evidence that it has transformed almost everybody’s lives for the better in innumerable ways, the kneejerk reaction of most people to something new is often worry, sometimes even disgust. Unless it is of obvious use to ourselves, we tend to imagine the bad consequences that might occur far more than the good ones. And we throw obstacles in the way of innovators, on behalf of those with a vested interest in the status quo: investors, managers and employees alike. History shows that innovation is a delicate and vulnerable flower, easily crushed underfoot, but quick to regrow if conditions allow. * kneejerk: 반사적인 ** status quo: 현 상태 ① Innovation comes from the need for solving deficiency. ② Innovative people are usually very sensitive to criticism. ③ Innovation is often faced with disapproval and opposition. ④ A single misstep in planning could ruin innovation entirely. ⑤ Innovative ideas need a series of revision and refinement. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? The immense improvement in the yield of farming during the twentieth century, as a result of innovations in mechanization, fertilizer, new varieties, pesticides and genetic engineering, has banished famine from the face of the planet almost entirely, and drastically reduced malnutrition, even while the human population has continued to expand. Few predicted this, yet many are concerned that this improvement has come at the expense of nature. In fact the evidence is strong that the opposite is the case. Innovation in food production has spared land and forest from the plough, the cow and the axe on a grand scale by increasing the productivity of the land we do farm. It turns out that this ‘land sparing’ has been much better for biodiversity than land sharing would have been ― by which is meant growing crops at low yields in the hope that abundant wildlife lives in fields alongside crops. ① 친환경 농법이 자연에 해로운 경우도 있다. ② 식량 생산 증가가 인구 증가로 이어지지는 않는다. ③ 생물 다양성이 높아지면서 생태계의 생산성도 높아졌다. ④ 대규모 경작보다 소규모 경작이 농업 생산성에 유리하다. ⑤ 농업 혁신이 식량 생산량을 늘리면서도 자연 훼손을 억제했다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? More recently there have been attempts to argue that unpaid work is work because ‘it is an activity that combines labour with raw materials to produce goods and services with enhanced economic value’. Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its ‘economic’ value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going. And while volunteering remains outside the GDP, its true value and importance is neglected. Governments continue to pay lip service to the importance of volunteering but ultimately deny it official recognition. * impute: 귀속시키다 ① efforts to utilise volunteering as a business strategy ② mistaken view of identifying volunteering with labour ③ obstacles to our understanding of the capitalist system ④ governmental endeavours to involve volunteers in public service ⑤ lack of appreciation for the economic significance of volunteering 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Amazingly, many businesses evaluate their customer service strategy by the number of complaints they get. ‘We have very few complaints from our customers, so we don’t need customer service training at the moment.’ I am told this regularly when prospecting for new clients. Either that or, ‘The number of complaints has dramatically decreased this year and we are very pleased, it seems our customer service initiatives are working’.

Waldemar Haffkine에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Waldemar Haffkine was born on the 16th of March 1860 at Odessa in Russia. He graduated in the Science Faculty of Odessa University in 1884. In 1889, Haffkine went to Paris to work at the Pasteur Institute, and did research to prepare a vaccine against cholera. His initial work on developing a cholera vaccine was successful. After a series of animal trials, in 1892 he tested the cholera vaccine on himself, risking his own life. During the Indian cholera epidemic of 1893, at the invitation of the Government of India he went to Calcutta and introduced his vaccine. After initial criticism by the local medical bodies, it was widely accepted. Haffkine was appointed as the director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called the Haffkine Institute). After his retirement in 1914, he returned to France and occasionally wrote for medical journals. He revisited Odessa in 1927, but could not adapt to the tremendous changes after the revolution in the country of his birth. He moved to Switzerland in 1928 and remained there for the last two years of his life. ① Pasteur Institute에서 일한 적이 있다. ② 콜레라 백신을 자기 자신에게 시험했다. ③ Calcutta로 가서 자신의 백신을 소개했다. ④ 은퇴 후 의학 저널에 글을 기고하지 않았다. ⑤ 생애 마지막 2년 동안 스위스에 머물렀다. 27. 2021 Multicultural Festival에 관한 다음 안내문의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? 2021 Multicultural Festival The 2021 Multicultural Festival is where you can enjoy different cultures of the world in one place and at one time.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the ①quantity of freight transported between nations was negligible by contemporary standards. For instance, during the Middle Ages, the totality of French imports via the Saint­Gothard Passage would not fill a freight train. The amount of freight transported by the Venetian fleet, which dominated Mediterranean trade, would not fill a ②modern container ship. The volume, but not the speed, of trade improved under mercantilism, notably for maritime transportation. In spite of all, distribution capacities were very limited and speeds ③slow. For example, a stagecoach going through the English countryside in the sixteenth century had an average speed of 2 miles per hour; moving one ton of cargo 30 miles inland in the United States by the late eighteenth century was as costly as moving it across the Atlantic. The inland transportation system was thus very ④limited. By the late eighteenth century, canal systems started to emerge in Europe.

I’m Maggie Morgan, a long­time fan of the Wakefield Community Theatre. I’m well aware that in this difficult economy, organisations such as the Wakefield Community Theatre are facing financial difficulties and therefore an increase in ticket prices is inevitable. But in my opinion, a 50 percent increase to the price of individual tickets seems totally unreasonable. It would mean that ordinary residents like myself will have fewer opportunities to enjoy a quality drama performance. Pricing tickets out of the range of local residents is not a good option, because it’ll hurt your organisation in years to come. I’m sure there will be other ways to get financial support instead of raising ticket prices so much. I hope to hear from you soon on this matter. ① 공연 관람권 가격 인상률에 이의를 제기하려고 ② 지역 주민을 위한 공연장 건립을 제안하려고 ③ 자선 연극 공연 개최에 감사하려고 ④ 공연 관람료의 단체 할인 가능 여부를 문의하려고 ⑤ 공연 취소로 입은 손실에 대해 보상을 요구하려고 19. 다음 글에 드러난 Tavil의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? Tavil feels he understands this buried world and he is ready to leave. But when he turns, the hole he’d climbed through no longer exists. In its place is a smooth wall of white tile, a continuation of the unending pattern throughout the tunnel. The broken scraps of debris that had littered the base of the hole are gone as well. And this is when he feels the horrifying truth of where he is: so deep underground that the climb down made the muscles in his legs and arms tremble. He is trapped. Brutally so. As if in a grave, in a tomb. Frightened, he claws at the tiles. He screams, not caring if someone hears; hoping they do and will cast him out. ① bored and lonely ② relieved and hopeful ③ thrilled and joyful ④ terrified and desperate ⑤ touched and grateful 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?

Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of innovation is how unpopular it is, for all the lip service we pay to it. Despite the abundant evidence that it has transformed almost everybody’s lives for the better in innumerable ways, the kneejerk reaction of most people to something new is often worry, sometimes even disgust. Unless it is of obvious use to ourselves, we tend to imagine the bad consequences that might occur far more than the good ones. And we throw obstacles in the way of innovators, on behalf of those with a vested interest in the status quo: investors, managers and employees alike. History shows that innovation is a delicate and vulnerable flower, easily crushed underfoot, but quick to regrow if conditions allow. * kneejerk: 반사적인 ** status quo: 현 상태 ① Innovation comes from the need for solving deficiency. ② Innovative people are usually very sensitive to criticism. ③ Innovation is often faced with disapproval and opposition. ④ A single misstep in planning could ruin innovation entirely. ⑤ Innovative ideas need a series of revision and refinement. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? The immense improvement in the yield of farming during the twentieth century, as a result of innovations in mechanization, fertilizer, new varieties, pesticides and genetic engineering, has banished famine from the face of the planet almost entirely, and drastically reduced malnutrition, even while the human population has continued to expand. Few predicted this, yet many are concerned that this improvement has come at the expense of nature. In fact the evidence is strong that the opposite is the case. Innovation in food production has spared land and forest from the plough, the cow and the axe on a grand scale by increasing the productivity of the land we do farm. It turns out that this ‘land sparing’ has been much better for biodiversity than land sharing would have been ― by which is meant growing crops at low yields in the hope that abundant wildlife lives in fields alongside crops. ① 친환경 농법이 자연에 해로운 경우도 있다. ② 식량 생산 증가가 인구 증가로 이어지지는 않는다. ③ 생물 다양성이 높아지면서 생태계의 생산성도 높아졌다. ④ 대규모 경작보다 소규모 경작이 농업 생산성에 유리하다. ⑤ 농업 혁신이 식량 생산량을 늘리면서도 자연 훼손을 억제했다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? More recently there have been attempts to argue that unpaid work is work because ‘it is an activity that combines labour with raw materials to produce goods and services with enhanced economic value’. Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its ‘economic’ value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going. And while volunteering remains outside the GDP, its true value and importance is neglected. Governments continue to pay lip service to the importance of volunteering but ultimately deny it official recognition. * impute: 귀속시키다 ① efforts to utilise volunteering as a business strategy ② mistaken view of identifying volunteering with labour ③ obstacles to our understanding of the capitalist system ④ governmental endeavours to involve volunteers in public service ⑤ lack of appreciation for the economic significance of volunteering 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Amazingly, many businesses evaluate their customer service strategy by the number of complaints they get. ‘We have very few complaints from our customers, so we don’t need customer service training at the moment.’ I am told this regularly when prospecting for new clients. Either that or, ‘The number of complaints has dramatically decreased this year and we are very pleased, it seems our customer service initiatives are working’. Companies using this type of measure are in denial. Although it is tempting to bury your head in the sand and believe no news is good news, trust me, if customers are not complaining to you, then they are complaining to other people or they are just never using your business again. The concerning thing is that customers who don’t complain there and then increasingly post their views on the Internet and through the social networking sites; they are no longer telling nine or so people but are probably telling thousands! ① Customers May Not Know What’s Best for Them ② Customer Silence Is Not Golden for Your Business ③ Dos and Don’ts of Processing Customer Complaints ④ Customer Service Improvement: No Laughing Matter ⑤ Empathy: A Key to Collecting Meaningful Consumer Feedback 4 영어영역 고3 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Unless it is of obvious use to ourselves, we tend to imagine the bad consequences that might occur far more than the good ones. And we throw obstacles in the way of innovators, on behalf of those with a vested interest in the status quo: investors, managers and employees alike. History shows that innovation is a delicate and vulnerable flower, easily crushed underfoot, but quick to regrow if conditions allow.* kneejerk: 반사적인  ** status quo: 현 상태  ① Innovation comes from the need for solving deficiency.   ② Innovative people are usually very sensitive to criticism.  ③ Innovation is often faced with disapproval and opposition.  ④ A single misstep in planning could ruin innovation entirely.  ⑤ Innovative ideas need a series of revision and refinement.

The immense improvement in the yield of farming during the twentieth century, as a result of innovations in mechanization, fertilizer, new varieties, pesticides and genetic engineering, has banished famine from the face of the planet almost entirely, and drastically reduced malnutrition, even while the human population has continued to expand. Few predicted this, yet many are concerned that this improvement has come at the expense of nature. In fact the evidence is strong that the opposite is the case. Innovation in food production has spared land and forest from the plough, the cow and the axe on a grand scale by increasing the productivity of the land we do farm. It turns out that this ‘land sparing’ has been much better for biodiversity than land sharing would have been ― by which is meant growing crops at low yields in the hope that abundant wildlife lives in fields alongside crops.  ① 친환경 농법이 자연에 해로운 경우도 있다.    ② 식량 생산 증가가 인구 증가로 이어지지는 않는다.   ③ 생물 다양성이 높아지면서 생태계의 생산성도 높아졌다.   ④ 대규모 경작보다 소규모 경작이 농업 생산성에 유리하다.   ⑤ 농업 혁신이 식량 생산량을 늘리면서도 자연 훼손을 억제했다.

[3점]     More recently there have been attempts to argue that unpaid work is work because ‘it is an activity that combines labour with raw materials to produce goods and services with enhanced economic value’. Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its ‘economic’ value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going. And while volunteering remains outside the GDP, its true value and importance is neglected. Governments continue to pay lip service to the importance of volunteering but ultimately deny it official recognition. * impute: 귀속시키다  ① efforts to utilise volunteering as a business strategy  ② mistaken view of identifying volunteering with labour  ③ obstacles to our understanding of the capitalist system  ④ governmental endeavours to involve volunteers in public service  ⑤ lack of appreciation for the economic significance of volunteering"

Amazingly, many businesses evaluate their customer service strategy by the number of complaints they get. ‘We have very few complaints from our customers, so we don’t need customer service training at the moment.’ I am told this regularly when prospecting for new clients.

Companies using this type of measure are in denial. Although it is tempting to bury your head in the sand and believe no news is good news, trust me, if customers are not complaining to you, then they are complaining to other people or they are just never using your business again.

He graduated in the Science Faculty of Odessa University in 1884. In 1889, Haffkine went to Paris to work at the Pasteur Institute, and did research to prepare a vaccine against cholera. His initial work on developing a cholera vaccine was successful. After a series of animal trials, in 1892 he tested the cholera vaccine on himself, risking his own life. During the Indian cholera epidemic of 1893, at the invitation of the Government of India he went to Calcutta and introduced his vaccine. After initial criticism by the local medical bodies, it was widely accepted. Haffkine was appointed as the director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called the Haffkine Institute). After his retirement in 1914, he returned to France and occasionally wrote for medical journals. He revisited Odessa in 1927, but could not adapt to the tremendous changes after the revolution in the country of his birth. He moved to Switzerland in 1928 and remained there for the last two years of his life.  ① Pasteur Institute에서 일한 적이 있다.       ② 콜레라 백신을 자기 자신에게 시험했다.  ③ Calcutta로 가서 자신의 백신을 소개했다.  ④ 은퇴 후 의학 저널에 글을 기고하지 않았다.   ⑤ 생애 마지막 2년 동안 스위스에 머물렀다.

Psychologists and neuroscientists warn that when we rely on technology to perform tasks such as navigation for us, as we become immersed instead in an abstract, computerized world. Studies show that we tend to place too much faith in the accuracy of information from computer monitors, and to ignore or discount information from our own eyes and ears, an effect that has caused pilots to crash planes and GPS­following tourists to drive into the sea. A team led by the British neuroscientist Hugo Spiers found in 2017 that areas of the brain normally involved in navigation just don’t engage when people use GPS. “When we have technology telling us which way to go,” said Spiers, “these parts of the brain simply don’t respond to the street network. In that sense our brain has switched off its interest in the streets around us.” ① we analyze information too thoroughly ② our awareness of our physical environment fades ③ our knowledge of the real world is not shared with others ④ our ability to emotionally connect to others is lost ⑤ unskilled manual labor is not appreciated 6 영어영역 고3 6 8 33. The conventional view of what the state should do to foster innovation is simple: it just needs to get out of the way. At best, governments merely facilitate the economic dynamism of the private sector; at worst, their lumbering, heavy­handed, and bureaucratic institutions actively inhibit it. The fast­moving, risk­loving, and pioneering private sector, by contrast, is what really drives the type of innovation that creates economic growth. According to this view, the secret behind Silicon Valley lies in its entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The state can intervene in the economy ― but only to fix market failures or level the playing field. It can regulate the private sector in order to account for the external costs companies may impose on the public, such as pollution, and it can invest in public goods, such as basic scientific research or the development of drugs with little market potential. It should not, however, . * lumbering: 느릿느릿 움직이는 ① involve the private sector in shaping economic policies ② directly attempt to create and shape markets ③ regulate companies under any circumstances ④ take market failures into consideration ⑤ let the private sector drive innovation 34.

There was a moment in research history when scientists wondered if the measure of choice ― total minutes of sleep ― was the wrong way of looking at the question of why sleep varies so considerably across species. Instead, they suspected that assessing sleep quality, rather than quantity (time), would shed some light on the mystery. (A) When we can, our understanding of the relationship between sleep quantity and quality across the animal kingdom will likely explain what currently appears to be an incomprehensible map of sleep­time differences. (B) In truth, the way quality is commonly assessed in these investigations (degree of unresponsiveness to the outside world and the continuity of sleep) is probably a poor index of the real biological measure of sleep quality: one that we cannot yet obtain in all these species. (C) That is, species with superior quality of sleep should be able to accomplish all they need in a shorter time, and vice versa. It was a great idea, with the exception that, if anything, we’ve discovered the opposite relationship: those that sleep more have deeper, “higher”­quality sleep. ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)",
