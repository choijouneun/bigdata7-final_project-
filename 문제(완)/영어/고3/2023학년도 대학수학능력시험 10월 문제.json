Extensive reading is the principal key to expanding one’s knowledge and keeping up with developments in a discipline. However, what is often overlooked here is that scientists are also obliged to be skillful writers. Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading.

            "보기": "Physicians and other natural scientists test their theories using controlled experiments. Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing.

In German, bridge (die brücke) is a feminine noun; in Spanish, bridge (el puente) is a masculine noun. Boroditsky found that when asked to describe a bridge, native German speakers used words like beautiful, elegant, slender. When native Spanish speakers were asked the same question, they used words like strong, sturdy, towering. (B) According to Stanford University psychology professor Lera Boroditsky, that’s not necessarily so. Focusing on the grammatical gender differences between German and Spanish, Boroditsky’s work indicates that the gender our language assigns to a given noun influences us to subconsciously give that noun characteristics of the grammatical gender. (C) This worked the other way around as well. The word key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish.

This is music’s greatest asset because it brings out the essential ‘now’ without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to ‘realize the present.’ Musical ‘meaning’ cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present­ing music — making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all — does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music. Yet, in spite of numerous attempts to develop a more musical music curriculum for the majority of school pupils, the emphasis is still on pupils absorbing factual information about music.  Music’s quality of being in the present is (A) in formal music education, where delivering factual knowledge is (B) .

Lots of research shows that we tend to be over­confident about how easy it is to be self­disciplined. This is why so many of us optimistically buy expensive gym memberships when paying per­visit fees would be cheaper, register for online classes we’ll never complete, and purchase family­size chips on discount to trim our monthly snack budget, only to consume every last crumb in a single sitting. We think “future me” will be able to make good choices, but too often “present me” gives in to temptation. People have a remarkable ability to their own failures. Even when we flounder again and again, many of us manage to maintain a rosy optimism about our ability to do better next time rather than learning from our past mistakes. We cling to fresh starts and other reasons to stay upbeat, which may help us get out of bed in the morning but can prevent us from approaching change in the smartest possible way. * crumb: 부스러기 ** flounder: 실패하다 *** upbeat: 낙관적인 ① criticize ② remind ③ ignore ④ detect ⑤ overestimate 32. The way we perceive the colors of the rainbow, and the universe in general, is influenced by the words we use to describe them. This is not limited to visual perception but also applies to smell, taste, touch, our perception of time and countless other human experiences. A wine or Scotch connoisseur, for example, has a much richer vocabulary at their disposal to describe the fullness, finish, flavors and aroma of the drink, which in turn improves their ability to recognize and remember subtle differences of which a non­expert may be unaware. Similarly, a chef or perfumer has at their disposal labels for flavors and smells that allow them to perceive, differentiate among, prepare and remember subtle variations. The labels that we have at our disposal influence how we see the world around us. Regardless of where you place the limits of linguistic effects on cognition, there is evidence that at least some of the things that we perceive and remember differ depending on .

A connection with ancestors, especially remote ones, is useful for getting a wide­angled, philosophical view of life. Whereas our immediate ancestors are notably skilled at helping us with the “little pictures,” namely the particular, the trees — say, a problem with a boss — our remote ones are best for seeing the “Big Picture,” namely the general, the forest — say, the meaning of our job. As modern people rush around blowing small problems out of proportion, thus contributing to a global anxiety epidemic, ancestral spirits have a broader perspective that can . When it comes to a trivial problem, for example, they’ll just tell us, “This too will pass.” They appreciate how rapidly and often things change. According to American anthropologist Richard Katz, for instance, Fijians say that from the ancestral viewpoint whatever looks unfortunate may turn out to be fortunate after all: “What may seem to be a horrible outcome ... is seen in another light by the ancestors.” The ancestors, it might be said, keep their heads when everyone around them is losing theirs. * epidemic: 확산 ** anthropologist: 인류학자 ① calm the disquieted soul ② boost cooperation in the community ③ make us stick to the specific details ④ result in a waste of time ⑤ complicate situations"

Its history is tied more broadly to the rise of modern science, philosophy, and politics. The effort to understand the causal relations that govern the physical world so as to intervene in these relations in ways that could, as Francis Bacon put it, “ameliorate the human condition,” marked the beginning of modernity in the West. For a long time, the “domination of nature” referred to this effort to understand and (a) control the nonhuman environment, and it was seen as a clearly good thing. This effort made (b) possible new technologies and rising economic prosperity, promised an end to many forms of human suffering, and demonstrated the triumph of reason over ignorance and superstition. Its costs began to be (c) invisible with industrialization in the nineteenth century, which generated obvious environmental damage and caused among many people a sense of alienation from the land and the more­than­human communities composing it. One sees a growing (d) unease about these costs in novels of the era such as Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), in poems like Wordsworth’s “Michael” (1800) and later Whitman’s Leaves of Grass (1855), and in the early nature writing of Thoreau’s Walden (1854). Yet systematic, critical analysis of the domination of nature as a problem came into its own only with the environmental studies movement in the 1970s.
