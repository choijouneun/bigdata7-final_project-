            "보기": "As the world seems to be increasingly affected by the ever-expanding influence of machines in general and artificial intelligence (AI) specifically, many begin to imagine, with either fear or anticipation, a future with a diminished role for human decision making. Whether it be due to the growing presence of AI assistants or the emergence of self-driving cars, the necessity of the role of humans as the decision makers would appear to be in decline. After all, our capacity for making mistakes is well documented. However, perhaps the saving grace of human determination is to be found here as well. Little evidence exists that suggests modern AI’s infallibility or predicts it in the future. It is crucial that, in light of humanity’s acceptance of our own fallibility, we utilize our capacity to overcome such failures to position ourselves as the overseers of AI’s own growth and applications for the foreseeable future.",

            "보기": "To balance the need for breadth (everyone feels a bit burned out) and depth (some are so burned out, they can no longer do their jobs), we ought to think of burnout not as a state but as a spectrum. In most public discussion of burnout, we talk about workers who “are burned out,” as if that status were black and white. A black-and-white view cannot account for the variety of burnout experience, though. If there is a clear line between burned out and not, as there is with a lightbulb, then we have no good way to categorize people who say they are burned out but still manage to do their work competently. Thinking about burnout as a spectrum solves this problem; those who claim burnout but are not debilitated by it are simply dealing with a partial or less-severe form of it. They are experiencing burnout without being burned out. Burnout hasn’t had the last word. * debilitate: 쇠약하게 하다",

The fact that everyone was going to be able to speak and listen had to be accommodated ethically, and it was via a rough egalitarianism. In terms of communications, people were equal and therefore it was believed they should be equal, or at least relatively so. By this code, ancient Big Men were not allowed to act controllingly and modern office managers are not allowed to silence anyone at will. Moreover, equal access to speech and hearing promoted the notion that property should be held in common, that goods and food in particular should be shared, and that everyone had a duty to take care of everyone else. This was probably more true among hunter-gatherers than it is in the modern family, circle of friends, or workplace. But even in these cases we believe that sharing and mutual aid are right and proper.

            "보기": "[3점] As far back as 32,000 years ago, prehistoric cave artists skillfully used modeling shadows to give their horses and bison volume. A few thousand years ago ancient Egyptian and then ancient Greek art presented human forms in shadow-style silhouette. But cast shadows do not appear in Western art until about 400 BCE in Athens. It was only after shadows had become an established, if controversial, part of representation that classical writers claimed that art itself had begun with the tracing of a human shadow. Greeks and Romans were the first to make the transition from modeling shadows to cast shadows, a practice that implied a consistent light source, a fixed point of view, and an understanding of geometric projection. In fact, what we might now call “shadow studies” ― the exploration of shadows in their various artistic representations ― has its roots in ancient Athens. Ever since, the practice of portraying shadows has evolved along with critical analysis of them, as artists and theoreticians have engaged in an ongoing debate about the significance of shadow representation. * geometric: 기하학의",

(A) Their role should be to assist, consult, and advise teams on how best to approach learning. They must be able to develop new mechanisms for cross-training peers ― team members ― and new systems for capturing and sharing information. To do this, human resource development professionals must be able to think systematically and understand how to promote learning within groups and across the organization. (B) For example, performance evaluation and reward systems that reinforce long-term performance and the development and sharing of new skills and knowledge are particularly important. In addition, the human resource development function may be dramatically changed to keep the emphasis on continuous learning. (C) In a learning organization, every employee must take the responsibility for acquiring and transferring knowledge. Formal training programs, developed in advance and delivered according to a preset schedule, are insufficient to address shifting training needs and encourage timely information sharing. Rather, human resource development professionals must become learning facilitators. [3점]",

The potential contribution of greater economic success, if it involves vulnerable groups, cannot be denied. At the same time, it is important to recognize that, no matter how fast they grow, countries where a large part of the population derive their livelihood from uncertain sources cannot hope to prevent famines without specialized entitlement protection mechanisms involving direct public intervention. Rapid growth of the economy in Botswana, or of the agricultural sector in Kenya, or of food production in Zimbabwe, explains at best only a small part of their success in preventing recurrent threats of famine. The real achievements of these countries lie in having provided direct public support to their populations in times of crisis. * famine: 기아 ** vulnerability: 취약 󰀻 Although economic growth can be somewhat (A) in diminishing a country’s risk of famine, direct approaches to helping the affected people play a(n) (B) role in this process.
