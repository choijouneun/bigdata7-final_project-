            "보기": "New ideas, such as those inspired by scientific developments, are often aired and critiqued in our popular culture as part of a healthy process of public debate, and scientists sometimes deserve the criticism they get. But the popularization of science would be greatly enhanced by improving the widespread images of the scientist. Part of the problem may be that the majority of the people who are most likely to write novels, plays, and film scripts were educated in the humanities, not in the sciences. Furthermore, the few scientists-turned-writers have used their scientific training as the source material for thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists. We need more screenplays and novels that present scientists in a positive light. In our contemporary world, television and film are particularly influential media, and it is likely that the introduction of more scientist-heroes would help to make science more attractive.",

            "보기": "[3점] The single most important change you can make in your working habits is to switch to creative work first, reactive work second. This means blocking off a large chunk of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with the phone and e-mail off. I used to be a frustrated writer. Making this switch turned me into a productive writer. Yet there wasn’t a single day when I sat down to write an article, blog post, or book chapter without a string of people waiting for me to get back to them. It wasn’t easy, and it still isn’t, particularly when I get phone messages beginning “I sent you an e-mail two hours ago...!” By definition, this approach goes against the grain of others’ expectations and the pressures they put on you. It takes willpower to switch off the world, even for an hour. It feels uncomfortable, and sometimes people get upset. But it’s better to disappoint a few people over small things, than to abandon your dreams for an empty inbox. Otherwise, you’re sacrificing your potential for the illusion of professionalism.",

It allows the project manager (or team) to “build the project in his or her head.” The project manager (or team) can consider different methodologies thereby deciding what works best or what does not work at all. This detailed thinking may be the only way to discover restrictions or risks that were not addressed in the estimating process. It would be far better to discover in the planning phase that a particular technology or material will not work than in the execution process. The goal of the planning process for the contractor is to produce a workable scheme that uses the resources efficiently within the allowable time and given budget.

The taking of roles in a narratively structured game of pirates is not very different than the taking of roles in identifying with characters as one watches a movie. It might be thought that, as they grow towards adolescence, people give up childhood play, but this is not so. Instead, the bases and interests of this activity change and develop to playing and watching sports, to the fiction of plays, novels, and movies, and nowadays to video games. In fiction, one can enter possible worlds. When we experience emotions in such worlds, this is not a sign that we are being incoherent or regressed.

Charles and Carstensen review a considerable body of evidence indicating that, as people get older, they tend to prioritize close social relationships, focus more on achieving emotional well-being, and attend more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative information. These changing motivational goals in old age have implications for attention to and processing of social cues from the environment. Of particular importance in considering emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity bias: that is, a tendency to notice, attend to, and remember more positive compared to negative information. The role of life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults might show gains in some aspects of social perception. * cognitive: 인식의 ** impair: 해치다",

Despite the large and complex song repertoire of European robins, they were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers. When they heard a tape recording of a stranger, they began to sing sooner, sang more songs, and overlapped their songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a neighbor’s song. As Brindley suggests, the overlapping of song may be an aggressive response. However, this difference in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when the neighbor’s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at the boundary between that neighbor’s territory and the territory of the bird being tested. If the same neighbor’s song was played at another boundary, one separating the territory of the test subject from another neighbor, it was treated as the call of a stranger. Not only does this result demonstrate that , but it also shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments is highly important. [3점] * robin: 울새 ** territory: 영역",

(A) There is a “good” outcome, in which both types of investments are made, and both the shipyard and the steelmakers end up profitable and happy. Equilibrium is reached. Then there is a “bad” outcome, in which neither type of investment is made. This second outcome also is an equilibrium because the decisions not to invest reinforce each other. (B) Assume that shipyards are the only potential customers of steel. Steel producers figure they’ll make money if there’s a shipyard to buy their steel, but not otherwise. Now we have two possible outcomes ― what economists call “multiple equilibria.” (C) But one key input is low-cost steel, and it must be produced nearby. The company’s decision boils down to this: if there is a steel factory close by, invest in shipbuilding; otherwise, don’t invest. Now consider the thinking of potential steel investors in the region.

According to Keith Thomas’s history Man and the Natural World, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century aristocrats began planting hardwood trees, usually in lines, to declare the extent of their property and the permanence of their claim to it. “What can be more pleasant,” the editor of a magazine for gentlemen asked his readers, “than to have the bounds and limits of your own property preserved and continued from age to age by the testimony of such living and growing witnesses?” Planting trees had the additional advantage of being regarded as a patriotic act, for the Crown had declared a severe shortage of the hardwood on which the Royal Navy depended. * aristocrat: 귀족 ** patriotic: 애국적인 󰀻 For English aristocrats, planting trees served as statements to mark the (A) ownership of their land, and it was also considered to be a(n) (B) of their loyalty to the nation.
