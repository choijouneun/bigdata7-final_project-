To the Principal of Gullard High School, My name is Nancy Watson, and I am the captain of the student dance club at Gullard High School. We are one of the biggest faces of the school, winning a lot of awards and trophies. However, the school isn’t allowing our club to practice on the school field because a lot of teachers worry that we are going to mess up the field. This is causing us to lose practice time and ultimately results in creating a bad high school experience for us. We promise to use the space respectfully. Therefore, I’m asking you to allow us to use the school field for our dance practice. I would be grateful if you reconsider your decision. Thank you very much.

Ryan, an eleven-year-old boy, ran home as fast as he could. Finally, summer break had started! When he entered the house, his mom was standing in front of the refrigerator, waiting for him. She told him to pack his bags. Ryan’s heart soared like a balloon. Pack for what? Are we going to Disneyland? He couldn’t remember the last time his parents had taken him on a vacation. His eyes beamed. “You’re spending the summer with uncle Tim and aunt Gina.” Ryan groaned. “The whole summer?” “Yes, the whole summer.” The anticipation he had felt disappeared in a flash. For three whole miserable weeks, he would be on his aunt and uncle’s farm. He sighed. ①excited → disappointed ②furious → regretful ③irritated → satisfied ④nervous → relaxed ⑤pleased → jealous 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? When trying to convince someone to change their mind, most people try to lay out a logical argument, or make a passionate plea as to why their view is right and the other person’s opinion is wrong. But when you think about it, you’ll realize that this doesn’t often work. As soon as someone figures out that you are on a mission to change their mind, the metaphorical shutters go down. You’ll have better luck if you ask well-chosen, open-ended questions that let someone challenge their own assumptions. We tend to approve of an idea if we thought of it first — or at least, if we think we thought of it first. Therefore, encouraging someone to question their own worldview will often yield better results than trying to force them into accepting your opinion as fact. Ask someone well-chosen questions to look at their own views from another angle, and this might trigger fresh insights. ①타인의 신뢰를 얻기 위해서는 일관된 행동을 보여 주어라. ②협상을 잘하기 위해 질문에 담긴 상대방의 의도를 파악하라. ③논쟁을 잘하려면 자신의 가치관에서 벗어나려는 시도를 하라. ④원만한 대인 관계를 유지하려면 상대를 배려하는 태도를 갖춰라. ⑤설득하고자 할 때 상대방이 스스로 관점을 돌아보게 하는 질문을 하라. 3 영어 영역 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 turns the life stories of these scientists from lead to gold가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] In school, there’s one curriculum, one right way to study science, and one right formula that spits out the correct answer on a standardized test. Textbooks with grand titles like The Principles of Physics magically reveal “the principles” in three hundred pages. An authority figure then steps up to the lectern to feed us “the truth.” As theoretical physicist David Gross explained in his Nobel lecture, textbooks often ignore the many alternate paths that people wandered down, the many false clues they followed, the many misconceptions they had. We learn about Newton’s “laws” — as if they arrived by a grand divine visitation or a stroke of genius — but not the years he spent exploring, revising, and changing them. The laws that Newton failed to establish — most notably his experiments in alchemy, which attempted, and spectacularly failed, to turn lead into gold — don’t make the cut as part of the one-dimensional story told in physics classrooms. Instead, our education system turns the life stories of these scientists from lead to gold. * lectern: 강의대 ** alchemy: 연금술 ①discovers the valuable relationships between scientists ②emphasizes difficulties in establishing new scientific theories ③mixes the various stories of great scientists across the world ④focuses more on the scientists’ work than their personal lives ⑤reveals only the scientists’ success ignoring their processes and errors 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? The vast majority of companies, schools, and organizations measure and reward “high performance” in terms of individual metrics such as sales numbers, résumé accolades, and test scores. The problem with this approach is that it is based on a belief we thought science had fully confirmed: that we live in a world of “survival of the fittest.” It teaches us that those with the best grades, or the most impressive résumé, or the highest point score, will be the ONLY ones to succeed. The formula is simple: be better and smarter and more creative than everyone else, and you will be successful. But this formula is inaccurate. Thanks to new research, we now know that achieving our highest potential is not about survival of the fittest but survival of the best fit. In other words, success is not just about how creative or smart or driven you are, but how well you are able to connect with, contribute to, and benefit from the ecosystem of people around you. * accolade: 수상, 표창 ①효율적인 업무 배분은 조직의 생산성을 향상시킨다. ②유연한 사고방식은 원활한 의사소통에 도움이 된다. ③사람들과 잘 어울려 일하는 능력이 성공을 가능하게 한다. ④비판적 사고 능력은 정확성을 추구하는 태도에서 출발한다. ⑤치열한 경쟁 사회에서 최고의 실력을 갖추는 것이 필수적이다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? I was brought up to believe that if I get lost in a large forest, I will sooner or later end up where I started. Without knowing it, people who are lost will always walk in a circle. In the book Finding Your Way Without Map or Compass, author Harold Gatty confirms that this is true. We tend to walk in circles for several reasons. The most important is that virtually no human has two legs of the exact same length. One leg is always slightly longer than the other, and this causes us to turn without even noticing it. In addition, if you are hiking with a backpack on, the weight of that backpack will inevitably throw you off balance. Our dominant hand factors into the mix too. If you are right-handed, you will have a tendency to turn toward the right. And when you meet an obstacle, you will subconsciously decide to pass it on the right side. ①abilities to construct a mental map for walking ②factors that result in people walking in a circle ③reasons why dominance exists in nature ④instincts that help people return home ⑤solutions to finding the right direction 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? In government, in law, in culture, and in routine everyday interaction beyond family and immediate neighbours, a widely understood and clearly formulated language is a great aid to mutual confidence. When dealing with property, with contracts, or even just with the routine exchange of goods and services, concepts and descriptions need to be as precise and unambiguous as possible, otherwise misunderstandings will arise. If full communication with a potential counterparty in a deal is not possible, then uncertainty and probably a measure of distrust will remain. As economic life became more complex in the later Middle Ages, the need for fuller and more precise communication was accentuated. A shared language facilitated clarification and possibly settlement of any disputes. In international trade also the use of a precise and well-formulated language aided the process of translation. The Silk Road could only function at all because translators were always available at interchange points. * accentuate: 강조하다 ①Earn Trust with Reliable Goods Rather Than with Words! ②Linguistic Precision: A Key to Successful Economic Transactions ③Difficulties in Overcoming Language Barriers and Distrust in Trade ④The More the Economy Grows, the More Complex the World Gets ⑤Excessive Confidence: The Biggest Reason for Miscommunication 4 영어 영역 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Percentage of Commuters Using Eco-friendly Transportation in Canada by City, 2016 The above graph shows the percentage of commuters using eco-friendly transportation to get to work in six large cities in Canada in 2016. ①For all six given cities, the percentage of people who commuted by public transit was the highest, while the percentage of people who commuted by cycling was the lowest. ②The percentages of people who commuted by walking were the same in both Toronto and Montréal even though the percentages of people who commuted by public transit in those two cities were different. ③In Vancouver, the percentage of people who commuted by public transit was over ten times higher than that of people who commuted by cycling. ④Even though Ottawa ranked fourth in the percentage of people who commuted by public transit, this city was in first place in the percentage of people who commuted by walking or cycling. ⑤Compared with Calgary, Edmonton recorded lower percentages for all three given types of eco-friendly transportation. 26. Alice Coachman에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Alice Coachman was born in 1923, in Albany, Georgia, U.S.A. Since she was unable to access athletic training facilities because of the racism of the time, she trained using what was available to her, running barefoot along the dirt roads near her home and using homemade equipment to practice her jumping. Her talent in track and field was noticeable as early as elementary school. Coachman kept practicing hard and gained attention with her achievements in several competitions during her time in high school and college. In the 1948 London Olympics, Coachman competed in the high jump, reaching 5 feet, 6.5 inches, setting both an Olympic and an American record. This accomplishment made her the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal. She is in nine different Halls of Fame, including the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Coachman died in 2014, at the age of 90 in Georgia after she had dedicated her life to education. ①집 근처에서 맨발로 달리며 훈련했다. ②육상 경기에서의 재능을 고등학교 때부터 보였다. ③런던 올림픽에서 높이뛰기 올림픽 기록과 미국 기록을 세웠다. ④흑인 여성 최초로 올림픽 금메달리스트가 되었다. ⑤9개의 명예의 전당에 올랐다. 27.

[3점] One of the keys to insects’ successful survival in the open air ①lies in their outer covering — a hard waxy layer that helps prevent their tiny bodies from dehydrating. To take oxygen from the air, they use narrow breathing holes in the body-segments, which take in air ②passively and can be opened and closed as needed. Instead of blood ③containing in vessels, they have free-flowing hemolymph, which helps keep their bodies rigid, aids movement, and assists the transportation of nutrients and waste materials to the appropriate parts of the body. The nervous system is modular — in a sense, each of the body segments has ④its own individual and autonomous brain — and some other body systems show a similar modularization. These are just a few of the many ways ⑤in which insect bodies are structured and function completely differently from our own. * hemolymph: 혈림프 ** modular: 모듈식의(여러 개의 개별 단위로 되어 있는) 30. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? On projects in the built environment, people consider safety and functionality nonnegotiable. But the aesthetics of a new project — how it is designed — is too often considered (A) relevant / irrelevant . The question of how its design affects human beings is rarely asked. People think that design makes something highfalutin, called architecture, and that architecture differs from building, just as surely as the Washington National Cathedral differs from the local community church. This (B) connection / distinction between architecture and building — or more generally, between design and utility — couldn’t be more wrong. More and more we are learning that the design of all our built environments matters so profoundly that safety and functionality must not be our only urgent priorities. All kinds of design elements influence people’s experiences, not only of the environment but also of themselves. They (C) overlook / shape our cognitions, emotions, and actions, and even our well-being. They actually help constitute our very sense of identity. * highfalutin: 허세를 부리는 (A) (B) (C) ①relevant …… distinction …… shape ②relevant …… connection …… overlook ③irrelevant …… distinction …… overlook ④irrelevant …… connection …… overlook ⑤irrelevant …… distinction …… shape [31 ~ 34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. Over 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth’s primordial atmosphere was probably largely water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen. The appearance and subsequent evolution of exceedingly primitive living organisms (bacteria-like microbes and simple single-celled plants) began to change the atmosphere, liberating oxygen and breaking down carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. This made it possible for higher organisms to develop. When the earliest known plant cells with nuclei evolved about 2 billion years ago, the atmosphere seems to have had only about 1 percent of its present content of oxygen. With the emergence of the first land plants, about 500 million years ago, oxygen reached about one-third of its present concentration. It had risen to almost its present level by about 370 million years ago, when animals first spread on to land. Today’s atmosphere is thus not just a requirement to sustain life as we know it ― it is also . * primordial: 원시의 ** sulfur dioxide: 이산화황 ①a barrier to evolution ②a consequence of life ③a record of primitive culture ④a sign of the constancy of nature ⑤a reason for cooperation among species 32. One of the primary ways by which music is able to take on significance in our inner world is by the way it interacts with memory. Memories associated with important emotions tend to be more deeply embedded in our memory than other events. Emotional memories are more likely to be vividly remembered and are more likely to be recalled with the passing of time than neutral memories. Since music can be extremely emotionally evocative, key life events can be emotionally heightened by the presence of music, ensuring that memories of the event become deeply encoded. Retrieval of those memories is then enhanced by contextual effects, in which a recreation of a similar context to that in which the memories were encoded can facilitate their retrieval. Thus, can activate intensely vivid memories of the event. * evocative: 불러일으키는 ** retrieval: 회복 ①analyzing memories of the event thoroughly ②increasing storage space for recalling the event ③re-hearing the same music associated with the event ④reconstructing the event in the absence of background music ⑤enhancing musical competence to deliver emotional messages 6 영어 영역 6 8 33. We are now , instead of the other way around. Perhaps the clearest way to see this is to look at changes in the biomass — the total worldwide weight — of mammals. A long time ago, all of us humans together probably weighed only about two-thirds as much as all the bison in North America, and less than one-eighth as much as all the elephants in Africa. But in the Industrial Era our population exploded and we killed bison and elephants at industrial scale and in terrible numbers. The balance shifted greatly as a result. At present, we humans weigh more than 350 times as much as all bison and elephants put together. We weigh over ten times more than all the earth’s wild mammals combined. And if we add in all the mammals we’ve domesticated — cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, and so on — the comparison becomes truly ridiculous: we and our tamed animals now represent 97 percent of the earth’s mammalian biomass. This comparison illustrates a fundamental point: instead of being limited by the environment, we learned to shape it to our own ends. [3점] * bison: 들소 ①imposing ourselves on nature ②limiting our ecological impact ③yielding our land to mammals ④encouraging biological diversity ⑤doing useful work for the environment 34. In the modern world, we look for certainty in uncertain places. We search for order in chaos, the right answer in ambiguity, and conviction in complexity. “We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world,” best-selling writer Yuval Noah Harari says, “than on trying to understand it.” We look for the easy-to-follow formula. Over time, we . Our approach reminds me of the classic story of the drunk man searching for his keys under a street lamp at night. He knows he lost his keys somewhere on the dark side of the street but looks for them underneath the lamp, because that’s where the light is. Our yearning for certainty leads us to pursue seemingly safe solutions — by looking for our keys under street lamps. Instead of taking the risky walk into the dark, we stay within our current state, however inferior it may be. [3점] ①weigh the pros and cons of our actions ②develop the patience to bear ambiguity ③enjoy adventure rather than settle down ④gain insight from solving complex problems ⑤lose our ability to interact with the unknown 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? As far back as the seventeenth century, hair had a special spiritual significance in Africa. Many African cultures saw the head as the center of control, communication, and identity in the body. ①Hair was regarded as a source of power that personified the individual and could be used for spiritual purposes or even to cast a spell. ②Since it rests on the highest point on the body, hair itself was a means to communicate with divine spirits and it was treated in ways that were thought to bring good luck or protect against evil. ③People had the opportunity to socialize while styling each other’s hair, and the shared tradition of hair was passed down. ④According to authors Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharps, “communication from the gods and spirits was thought to pass through the hair to get to the soul.” ⑤In Cameroon, for example, medicine men attached hair to containers that held their healing potions in order to protect the potions and enhance their effectiveness. * potion: (마법의) 물약 [36 ~ 37] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 36. Mark Granovetter examined the extent to which information about jobs flowed through weak versus strong ties among a group of people. (A) This means that they might have information that is most relevant to us, but it also means that it is information to which we may already be exposed. In contrast, our weaker relationships are often with people who are more distant both geographically and demographically. (B) Their information is more novel. Even though we talk to these people less frequently, we have so many weak ties that they end up being a sizable source of information, especially of information to which we don’t otherwise have access. (C) He found that only a sixth of jobs that came via the network were from strong ties, with the rest coming via medium or weak ties; and with more than a quarter coming via weak ties. Strong ties can be more homophilistic. Our closest friends are often those who are most like us. * demographically: 인구통계학적으로 ** homophilistic: 동족친화적인 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 7 영어 영역 7 8 37. When we think of culture, we first think of human cultures, of our culture. We think of computers, airplanes, fashions, teams, and pop stars. For most of human cultural history, none of those things existed. (A) Sadly, this remains true as the final tribal peoples get overwhelmed by those who value money above humanity. We are living in their end times and, to varying extents, we’re all contributing to those endings. Ultimately our values may even prove self-defeating. (B) They held extensive knowledge, knew deep secrets of their lands and creatures. And they experienced rich and rewarding lives; we know so because when their ways were threatened, they fought to hold on to them, to the death. (C) For hundreds of thousands of years, no human culture had a tool with moving parts. Well into the twentieth century, various human foraging cultures retained tools of stone, wood, and bone. We might pity human hunter-gatherers for their stuck simplicity, but we would be making a mistake.

But the flowing takes time, and if your speed of impact is too great, the water won’t be able to flow away fast enough, and so it pushes back at you. Liquids are destructive. Foams feel soft because they are easily compressed; if you jump on to a foam mattress, you’ll feel it give beneath you. ( ①) Liquids don’t do this; instead they flow. ( ②) You see this in a river, or when you turn on a tap, or if you use a spoon to stir your coffee. ( ③) When you jump off a diving board and hit a body of water, the water has to flow away from you. ( ④) It’s that force that stings your skin as you belly-flop into a pool, and makes falling into water from a great height like landing on concrete. ( ⑤) The incompressibility of water is also why waves can have such deadly power, and in the case of tsunamis, why they can destroy buildings and cities, tossing cars around easily. ＊compress: 압축하다 ** give: (힘을 받아) 휘다 39. However, according to Christakis and Fowler, we cannot transmit ideas and behaviours much beyond our friends’ friends’ friends (in other words, across just three degrees of separation). In the late twentieth century, researchers sought to measure how fast and how far news, rumours or innovations moved. ( ①) More recent research has shown that ideas ― even emotional states and conditions ― can be transmitted through a social network. ( ②) The evidence of this kind of contagion is clear: ‘Students with studious roommates become more studious. Diners sitting next to heavy eaters eat more food.’ ( ③) This is because the transmission and reception of an idea or behaviour requires a stronger connection than the relaying of a letter or the communication that a certain employment opportunity exists. ( ④) Merely knowing people is not the same as being able to influence them to study more or over-eat. ( ⑤) Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, even when it is unconscious.

In 2011, Micah Edelson and his colleagues conducted an interesting experiment about external factors of memory manipulation. In their experiment, participants were shown a two minute documentary film and then asked a series of questions about the video. Directly after viewing the videos, participants made few errors in their responses and were correctly able to recall the details. Four days later, they could still remember the details and didn’t allow their memories to be swayed when they were presented with any false information about the film. This changed, however, when participants were shown fake responses about the film made by other participants. Upon seeing the incorrect answers of others, participants were also drawn toward the wrong answers themselves. Even after they found out that the other answers had been fabricated and didn’t have anything to do with the documentary, it was too late.

Evolutionary biologists believe sociability drove the evolution of our complex brains. Fossil evidence shows that as far back as 130,000 years ago, it was not (a) unusual for Homo sapiens to travel more than a hundred and fifty miles to trade, share food and, no doubt, gossip. Unlike the Neanderthals, their social groups extended far beyond their own families. Remembering all those (b) connections, who was related to whom, and where they lived required considerable processing power. It also required wayfinding savvy. Imagine trying to (c)maintain a social network across tens or hundreds of square miles of Palaeolithic wilderness. You couldn’t send a text message to your friends to find out where they were ― you had to go out and visit them, remember where you last saw them or imagine where they might have gone. To do this, you needed navigation skills, spatial awareness, a sense of direction, the ability to store maps of the landscape in your mind and the motivation to travel around. Canadian anthropologist Ariane Burke believes that our ancestors (d) developed all these attributes while trying to keep in touch with their neighbours. Eventually, our brains became primed for wayfinding. Meanwhile the Neanderthals, who didn’t travel as far, never fostered a spatial skill set; despite being sophisticated hunters, well adapted to the cold and able to see in the dark, they went extinct. In the prehistoric badlands, nothing was more (e) useless than a circle of friends. * savvy: 요령, 지식 ** Palaeolithic: 구석기 시대의 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ①Social Networks: An Evolutionary Advantage ②Our Brain Forced Us to Stay Close to Our Family! ③How We Split from Our Way and Kept Going on My Way ④Why Do Some People Have Difficulty in Social Relationships? ⑤Being Connected to Each Other Leads to Communicative Skills 42. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?

Tonight, Santa will drop by our house to leave you some presents.” Martha told (a) her little girl, smiling. “And for you too, Fred,” she added. She wanted to give her two children so much more, but this year had been especially hard for Martha. She had worked day and night to buy some Christmas gifts for her children. (B) Emma came running up to her mother the next morning. “Mommy, Santa really did come last night!” Martha smiled, thinking of the candies and cookies (b) she must have found in her socks. “Did you like his gifts?” “Yes, they are wonderful. Fred loves his toys, too.” Martha was confused. She wondered how the candies and cookies had become toys overnight. Martha ran into Emma’s room and saw a small red box that was half open. She knelt down and glanced inside to see its contents. (C) That night, after everyone had gone to bed, Emma slowly climbed out of bed. She took out a page from a notebook to write a letter to Santa. She whispered to herself as she wrote. “Dear Santa, will you send a few smiles and laughs for my mother? (c) She doesn’t laugh much. And will you send a few toys for Fred as well? Thank you.” Emma folded the letter twice and sealed it within an envelope. She left the envelope outside the front door and went back to sleep. (D) The box contained some toys, countless little candies and cookies. “Mommy, this is for you from Santa.” Emma said holding out a card towards Martha. Puzzled, (d) she opened it. It said, “Dear Emma’s mother. A very merry Christmas! Hi, I am Amelia. I found your child’s letter blowing across the street last night. I was touched and couldn’t help but respond. Please accept the gift as a Christmas greeting.” Martha felt tears falling down (e) her cheeks. She slowly wiped them off and hugged her daughter. “Merry Christmas, Emma. Didn’t I tell you Santa would come?” 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ①(a) ②(b) ③(c) ④(d) ⑤(e) 45. 윗글에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ①올해는 Martha에게 힘든 한 해였다. ②Fred가 선물받은 장난감을 마음에 들어 했다. ③Martha가 자신의 방에서 작은 빨간 상자를 보았다. ④Emma가 산타에게 편지를 썼다. ⑤Emma가 Martha에게 산타가 보냈다고 말하며 카드를 내밀었다. ※ 확인 사항 답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인하시오."
