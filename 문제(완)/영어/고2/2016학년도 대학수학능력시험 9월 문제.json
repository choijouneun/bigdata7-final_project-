Dear Ms. Jones, Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention―as a parent, I know it can be hard to ask these kinds of questions. I understand your concern about the degree of work involved in this class project, as well as your request for a deadline extension. We’ve been working hard on this over the course of the last month in order to spread out the work. In case you didn’t see it, I’m enclosing a copy of our class calendar as a helpful reference. Given the way we’ve been working up to this deadline, I’m afraid I can’t accept your request. I feel confident this is a fair timeline. I believe we can reach an understanding together. Thank you.

In the film The Karate Kid, the teenaged Daniel asks the wise Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate. ①The old man agrees and orders Daniel first to wax his car in precisely opposed circular motions. Then he tells Daniel to paint ②his wooden fence in precise up and down motions. Finally, ③he makes Daniel hammer nails to repair a wall. Daniel is puzzled at first, then angry. He wants to learn the martial arts so he can defend himself. Instead he is limited to household chores. When Daniel is finished restoring Miyagi’s car, fence, and walls, he explodes with rage at ④his “mentor.” Miyagi physically attacks Daniel, who without thought or hesitation defends ⑤himself with the core thrusts and parries of karate. Through Miyagi’s deceptively simple chores, Daniel has absorbed the basics of karate ― without knowing it. * thrust and parry: 찌르기와 막기 20. 다음 글의 상황에 나타난 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은? Granddaddy said, “Viola, won’t you have a glass?” Viola glanced at Mother and then said, “No, no, Mr. Tate, I couldn’t ―.” He ignored her and put a glass into her hands and then another into SanJuanna’s hands. They all stood and raised their glasses in celebration. We imitated them with glasses of milk, laughing. Father spoke. “To our good health, to our continuing prosperity, and, on this grand occasion, to Grandfather and his scientific accomplishment. I must admit that there were times when I wondered about the way you spend your time, but you have proven it to be all worthwhile. We are a proud family tonight!” Harry started up a chorus of “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” and then led them all in giving three cheers. ① calm and peaceful ② festive and exciting ③ sad and sorrowful ④ dangerous and urgent ⑤ solemn and sacred 고2 영어영역 3 3 8 21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Some organizations may be reluctant to facilitate their employees’ participation in volunteer activities. They may believe it’s none of their business: if employees want to do volunteer activity, they can make their own arrangements and do so on their own time. Corporations also may be concerned about allocating the resources needed to set up such programs, or perhaps they fear that facilitating employees’ engagement elsewhere may weaken their commitment to the organization or their jobs. Not to worry on that last point: research shows that participating in corporate volunteer activity heightens rather than weakens employees’ organizational commitment, in part because people feel a sense of self­worth when they do the good deeds that their organizations made it easier for them to do. ① 기업의 사회 봉사활동은 기업 이미지를 긍정적으로 만든다. ② 성과에 따른 적절한 보상은 직원의 만족도를 향상시킨다. ③ 직원의 봉사활동을 지원하는 것은 회사에 도움이 된다. ④ 기업은 자선 단체에 대한 후원을 확대할 필요가 있다. ⑤ 자기 계발과 회사 업무 간의 균형이 중요하다. 22. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Too many people suffer from destination disease. They reach a certain level, earn their degrees, buy their dream homes, and then just coast. Studies show 50 percent of high school graduates never read another entire book. One reason may be that they see learning as something you do in school, just something you do for a period of life instead of as a way of life. We all learned when we were in school. Our teachers, coaches, and parents taught us. We were expected to learn when we were school age. But some tend to think that once they finish a certain level of education: “I’m done with school. I’ve got a good job.” Winners never stop learning. Whether you’re nine or ninety years old, you should constantly be learning, improving your skills, and getting better at what you do. * coast: (과거의 실적에 기대어) 힘들이지 않고 살아가다 ① 학창 시절 이후에도 배움을 멈추지 말아야 한다. ② 삶의 단계별 목표를 구체적으로 설정해야 한다. ③ 연령에 맞는 학습 방법을 활용해야 한다. ④ 깊이 생각하며 책을 읽는 습관을 들여야 한다. ⑤ 학교는 평생 교육 프로그램 개발에 힘써야 한다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the ruling elite. Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was relatively easy for imperial elites to adopt ideas, norms, and traditions from wherever they found them, rather than to stick to a single rigid tradition. While some emperors sought to purify their cultures and return to what they viewed as their roots, for the most part empires have produced hybrid civilizations that absorbed much from their subject peoples. The imperial culture of Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. Imperial Mongol culture was a Chinese copycat. In the imperial United States, an American president of Kenyan blood can eat Italian pizza while watching his favorite film, Lawrence of Arabia, a British epic about the Arab rebellion against the Turks. * hybrid: 잡종의, 합성의 ① reasons for the collapse of great empires ② severe moral corruption of imperial elites ③ distinct differences among ancient empires ④ impacts of ancient Rome on Western culture ⑤ integrative characteristics of empire civilizations 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? People who communicate to others about themselves rather freely, who are frank and open, who express their views, opinions, knowledge, and feelings freely, and who share their knowledge and personal experiences with others can be considered as the self­disclosing type. These people constantly communicate with others and make an impact on them. This communication or self­disclosure helps in generating data and such an individual has more of an open and public self than private self. Without an optimal amount of self­disclosure we deny an opportunity for others to know us and for ourselves to get appropriate feedback. People who don’t communicate openly are private individuals who may have difficulty discovering themselves fully. At least it is difficult for them to see themselves fully through the eyes of others and also they make limited impact on others. ① Why We Fear Self­disclosure ② Open Yourself Up for Yourself ③ How to Be Honest Without Being Harsh ④ Don’t Underestimate the Power of Feedback ⑤ Confidence: A Key to Effective Communication 4 영어영역 고2 4 8 25. Paul Klee에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Paul Klee was born in Bern, Switzerland, on December 18, 1879. His father was a music teacher and his mother was a singer and an amateur painter. As a child, Paul drew constantly. His favorite subject was cats. Then at the age of seven, he learned to play the violin, which he continued throughout his adult life. In fact, he even played with the Berlin Municipal Orchestra for a while. Although music was important to Paul, he became an artist. In 1898, he began his art career by studying at the Munich Academy. After, from January 1921 to April 1931, he taught painting at the Bauhaus. Paul also kept a notebook of his artistic insights and ideas and published a number of books about art. By his death in 1940, he had created an impressive amount of work: over ten thousand drawings and nearly five thousand paintings during his lifetime. ① 어머니가 가수이자 아마추어 화가였다. ② 어렸을 때 고양이를 그리는 것을 좋아했다. ③ Berlin Municipal Orchestra와 함께 연주한 적이 있다. ④ 1898년에 Munich Academy에서 회화를 가르쳤다. ⑤ 미술에 관한 많은 책을 출판했다. 26.

[3점] Before the washing machine was invented, people used washboards to scrub, or they carried their laundry to riverbanks and streams, ①where they beat and rubbed it against rocks. Such backbreaking labor is still commonplace in parts of the world, but for most homeowners the work is now done by a machine that ②automatically regulates water temperature, measures out the detergent, washes, rinses, and spin­dries. With ③its electrical and mechanical system, the washing machine is one of the most technologically advanced examples of a large household appliance. It not only cleans clothes, but it ④is so with far less water, detergent, and energy than washing by hand requires. ⑤Compared with the old washers that squeezed out excess water by feeding clothes through rollers, modern washers are indeed an electrical­mechanical phenomenon. 고2 영어영역 5 5 8 29. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] Sadness in our culture is often considered an unnecessary and undesirable emotion. Numerous self­help books promote the benefits of positive thinking and positive behaviors, assigning negative affect in general, and sadness in particular, to the category of “problem emotions” that need to be (A) promoted / eliminated . Much of the psychology profession is employed in managing and relieving sadness. Yet some degree of sadness and depression has been far more (B) accepted / discouraged in previous historical ages than is the case today. From the classic philosophers through Shakespeare to the works of Chekhov, Ibsen, and the great novels of the 19th century, exploring the emotions of sadness, longing, and depression has long been considered (C) destructive / instructive . It is only recently that a thriving industry promoting positivity has managed to remove this earlier and more balanced view of human affectivity. (A) (B) (C) ① promoted …… accepted …… destructive ② promoted …… discouraged …… destructive ③ eliminated …… accepted …… destructive ④ eliminated …… discouraged …… instructive ⑤ eliminated …… accepted …… instructive 30. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the percentages of people aged 16-29 and 30 and over who read e­books on each device in 2011. ①For people aged 16-29, desktops or laptops are the most widely used devices, and tablets are the least. ②On the other hand, people aged 30 and over read e­books on e­readers the most and on cell phones the least. ③The percentage point difference between the use of desktops or laptops and cell phones in ages 30 and over is more than 10 points. ④The percentage of e­reader use among people aged 30 and over is twice as large as that among people aged 16-29. ⑤Tablets are the only devices used by less than 20 percent of people in both age groups.

And yet adjusting what you eat is entirely possible. We do it all the time. Were this not the case, the food companies that launch new products each year would be wasting their money. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, housewives from East and West Germany tried each other’s food products for the first time in decades. It didn’t take long for those from the East to realize that they preferred Western yogurt to their own. Equally, those from the West discovered a liking for the honey and vanilla wafer biscuits of the East. From both sides of the wall, these German housewives showed a remarkable in their food preferences. ① simplicity ② flexibility ③ difference ④ resistance ⑤ consistency 32. Life is a balancing act, and so is our sense of morality. Research suggests that when we view ourselves as morally deficient in one part of our lives, we search for moral actions that will balance out the scale. Maybe you know you should be recycling but just never get around to gathering up your glass, paper, and plastics in time for the recycling truck. One day you happen to be walking through a hardware store and notice a rack of energy­efficient light bulbs, and you instantly decide to buy twenty of them and change out every bulb in your house. The moral deficiency (not recycling) is, in your view, balanced by a moral action (installing energy­efficient bulbs). The problem is that the seesaw can also tip the other way: If we believe we are doing enough, morally speaking, then there’s little reason to do more. The scale . [3점] ① is already level ② demands sacrifice ③ is energy­efficient ④ cannot be measured ⑤ will read the true weight 6 영어영역 고2 6 8 33. The gap between the reality of online life and how we experience it prevents our discussion of Internet privacy. Consider email. People “know” email is not private. And yet many will use email, at least sometimes, for intimate correspondence. Over decades, I have asked why. The answer is always the same: When you stare at a screen, you feel completely alone. That sense of being alone with the person to whom you are writing ― as though you were the only two people in the world ― often blocks out what you know to be true. Email can be seen; it will be stored; and then it can be seen again. The seeming ephemerality of what is on the screen masks the truth: What you write is not erasable. More generally, the experience of the net . [3점] * ephemerality: 단명, 덧없음 ① weakens intimacy and trust ② undermines the reality of the net ③ boosts our cooperation on the net ④ makes us aware of privacy issues ⑤ helps to recognize things as they are 34. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? One line of research suggests that how often you go over material is less critical than the depth of processing that you engage in. (A) , if you expect to remember what you read, you have to wrestle fully with its meaning. Many students could probably benefit if they spent less time on rote repetition and more on actually paying attention to and analyzing the meaning of their reading assignments. In particular, it is useful to make material personally meaningful. When you read your textbooks, try to relate information to your own life and experience. (B) , if you’re reading in your psychology text about the personality trait of confidence, you can think about which people you know who are particularly confident and why you would characterize them as being that way. * rote: 기계적으로 암기하는 (A) (B) ①Thus …… In contrast ②Thus …… For example ③Similarly …… In contrast ④However …… For example ⑤However …… Therefore 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Tourism is one of many contributors to changes in the climate system. As with other human activities, there are many ways and spatial scales at which tourism contributes to climate change. ①For example, changes in land cover and use, such as replacing forest with resort buildings and other structures, can modify the local climate. ②Local climate changes may also be caused when air pollutants are emitted by the structures’ incinerators, by stationary and mobile engines, and during land­clearing activities. ③Tourism and tourists can generate job and business opportunities in both the formal and informal sector. ④Gradually, over space and time, even these locally focused human activities are known to change the climate, regionally and globally. ⑤They work together with more global scale forces such as those related to emissions from aircraft carrying tourists to and from their destinations. * incinerator: 소각로 [36~37] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오. 36. Today, such delays between ideas and application are almost unthinkable. Scientific discoveries are being brought to fruition at a faster rate than ever before. ( ① ) For example, in 1836, a machine was invented that mowed, threshed, and tied straw into bundles and poured grain into sacks. ( ②) The machine was based on technology that even then was twenty years old, but it was not until 1930 that such a machine actually was marketed. ( ③) The first English patent for a typewriter was issued in 1714, but another 150 years passed before typewriters were commercially available. ( ④) It is not that we are more eager or more ambitious than our ancestors but that we have, over time, invented all sorts of social devices to hasten the process. ( ⑤) Thus, we find that the time between the first and second stages of the innovative cycle ― between idea and application ― has been cut radically. * thresh: 타작하다 고2 영어영역 7 7 8 37. However, in order to solve this problem creatively, it may be useful to redefine it as a problem of too many vehicles requiring a space to sit in during the workday. Most of us have problems that have been posed to us (e.g., assignments from our supervisors). ( ①) But we also recognize problems on our own (e.g., the need for additional parking space in the city where you work). ( ②) After identifying the existence of a problem, we must define its scope and goals. ( ③) The problem of parking space is often seen as a need for more parking lots or parking garages. ( ④) In that case, you may decide to organize a carpool among people who use downtown parking lots and institute a daytime local taxi service using these privately owned vehicles. ( ⑤) Thus, you solve the problem not as you originally posed it but as you later reconceived it. [38~39] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 38. Evolution did not give humans the ability to play soccer. True, it produced legs for kicking and elbows for fouling, but all that this enables us to do is perhaps practice penalty kicks alone. (A) Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by instinct — puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough­and­tumble play built into their genes. (B) But human teenagers have no such genes for soccer. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about soccer. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game. (C) To get into a game with the strangers we find in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before, we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing by the same rules.

The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet. (A) The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits and snails for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrow’s menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients. (B) The typical peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she was lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs. (C) Especially in pre­modern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop ― such as wheat, potatoes, or rice ― that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional materials humans need.

Some companies provide their employees with cafeteria incentive programs. The term cafeteria is used because choices are similar to those in a cafeteria, in which a diner proceeds down the line and chooses those foods that he or she would like and leaves the others. Cafeteria incentives take a variety of forms. In many cases, the company will put aside a pool of money that each individual can spend on these options, such as $3,000 annually. Then, if one person has a family with two small children and wants to use some of this money for a child­care program, the costs are automatically deducted from that employee’s pool of money. Another individual might purchase additional life insurance or medical coverage to meet his or her specific needs. At Lincoln Electric, for example, all payments for worker medical insurance come from the bonus pool. The employees decide what type of coverage they want and the cost is deducted from their bonus. * deduct: 공제하다  Cafeteria incentive programs provide employees with (A) choices, and employees’ selections are based on their (B) .

Intelligence once meant more than what any artificial intelligence does. It used to include sensibility, sensitivity, awareness, reason, wit, etc. And yet we readily call machines intelligent now. Affective is another word that once meant a lot more than what any machine can deliver. Yet we have become used to describing machines that portray emotional states or can sense our emotional states as exemplars of “affective computing.” These new meanings become our new normal, and we forget other meanings. We have to struggle to recapture lost language, lost meanings, and perhaps, in time, lost experiences. At one conference I attended, the robots were called “caring machines,” and when I objected, I was told we were using this word not because the robots care but because they will take care of us. The conference participants believed caring is a behavior, a function, not a feeling. They seemed puzzled: Why did I care so much about semantics? What’s wrong with me? It is natural for words to change their meaning over time and with new circumstances. Intelligence and affective have changed their meaning to what machines can do. But now the words caring, friend, companionship, and conversation? A lot is at stake in these words. They are not yet lost. We need to remember these words and this conversation before we don’t know how to have it. Or before we think we can have it with a machine. * semantics: (언어학의 일종인) 의미론 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① What’s Lost When a Language Dies ② Artificial Intelligence: Good or Evil? ③ Will Robots Care for You in the Future? ④ Harmony Between Humans and Machines ⑤ Beware of Losing the Meaning of Words 42. 윗글의 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?

(A) It was August 18, 1999, back near the start of our inspirational trip across the U.S. My husband and I visited a center for children with special needs in Portland, Oregon. After receiving a gift from me, a bright­eyed young boy, Michael, reached into his pocket, retrieved something, and held it hidden in his closed fist. “Now I want to give you something,” (a) he smiled, extending his hand to me. “It’s for luck. I found it this morning.” I opened my palm. Onto it he dropped something moist and green. (B) I told Michael that I greatly appreciated (b) his gesture, that I would enjoy holding his clover for the rest of my visit there, and that I would certainly take the memory of it with me. However, I did not want to take the actual clover with me; I wanted him to keep it for himself. “Why?” (c) he asked. “Four­leaf clovers are rare and hard to find,” I answered. “I used to look for them a lot and I never found one.” (C) For a second I felt confused. But then I recognized it as a clover that, indeed, had four leaves on just one stem. I got a quick flash­back to when my cousin, John, and I looked for four­leaf clovers when we were about the same age as Michael. (d) He and I would search through patches of clover at our grandparents’ house for hours. When we got tired of the quest, we would each “make” a four­leaf clover by combining a regular three­leaf clover with a stem from which two of the leaves had been removed. We held the two stems together just so and tried to make the combo look like a true four­leaf clover. We never did find a real one. (D) “Really?” he said. “Really,” I said, and went on to tell him about how I created those look­alikes. “Then for sure I want you to have this real one,” said Michael. “I find them all the time. Don’t worry. I’ll find another one.” I marveled at the pureness of his loving. And I was struck by the symbolism. For Michael, those four­leafed clovers were like love. (e) He gave plenty away and always found plenty more. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a) ~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? ① ‘I’는 남편과 함께 장애 아동 시설을 방문했다. ② Michael은 ‘I’를 만난 날 아침에 네 잎 클로버를 찾았다. ③ ‘I’는 Michael에게 네 잎 클로버를 돌려주려고 했다. ④ ‘I’는 사촌과 함께 네 잎 클로버를 발견한 적이 있다. ⑤ ‘I’는 Michael에게 네 잎 클로버를 만들었던 경험을 들려주었다. * 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인 하시오."
