It had been a hot sunny day and the air was heavy and still. I saw a large fountain in the middle of the town square but there was no water. The square was empty except for a black cat staring at me with a scary, sharp look. The shops were closed and there was no one about. I started to grow anxious as it got dark. I walked across to a cafe and sat down at a table, putting my bag on the seat beside me. The cafe was empty except for two rough­looking men at a table next to the window. They observed me threateningly and suddenly started to approach me. I really wanted to escape. ① fearful ② pleased ③ relieved ④ curious ⑤ indifferent 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Strong negative feelings are part of being human. Problems occur when we try too hard to control or avoid these feelings. A helpful way of coping with strong negative feelings is to take them for what they are ― messages from your mind and body intended to keep you safe. For instance, if you are afraid of a work presentation, trying to avoid your anxiety will likely reduce your confidence and increase your fear. Instead, try to accept your anxiety as a signal that you are probably nervous about public speaking ― just like most other people. This helps you lower the level of your anxiety and stress, increasing your confidence and making the presentation much easier. ① 자신의 생각을 정확하게 전달하라. ② 타인에 대한 공감능력을 향상시켜라. ③ 익숙한 상황을 비판적 관점으로 보라. ④ 정서적 안정을 위해서 자신감을 키워라. ⑤ 부정적인 감정을 있는 그대로 받아들여라. 영어영역 고1 3 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3 8 21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? An interesting study about facial expressions was recently published by the American Psychological Association. Fifteen Chinese people and fifteen Scottish people took part in the study. They viewed emotion­neutral faces that were randomly changed on a computer screen and then categorized the facial expressions as happy, sad, surprised, fearful, or angry. The responses allowed researchers to identify the expressive facial features that participants associated with each emotion. The study found that the Chinese participants relied more on the eyes to tell facial expressions, while the Scottish participants relied on the eyebrows and mouth. People from different cultures perceive happy, sad, or angry facial expressions in different ways. That is, facial expressions are not the “universal language of emotions.” ① 문화에 따라 표정을 인식하는 방식이 다르다. ② 동서양을 막론하고 선호하는 표정이 있다. ③ 노력을 통해 좋은 인상을 줄 수 있다. ④ 사람마다 고유한 감정 표현 방식이 있다. ⑤ 지나친 감정 표현은 오해를 불러일으킬 수 있다. 22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? When you face a severe source of stress, you may fight back, reacting immediately. While this served your ancestors well when they were attacked by a wild animal, it is less helpful today unless you are attacked physically. Technology makes it much easier to worsen a situation with a quick response. I know I have been guilty of responding too quickly to people, on email in particular, in a harsh tone that only made things worse. The more something causes your heart to race, the more important it is to step back before speaking or typing a single word. This will give you time to think things through and find a way to deal with the other person in a healthier manner. ① origins of violent human behaviors ② benefits of social media technology ③ importance of taking time in responding ④ relationship between health and heartbeat ⑤ difficulties in controlling emotional reactions 23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? On college campuses in the U.S. and around the world, some animals are helping students in need. With many students reporting depression and anxiety, school officials arrange pet therapy events to spread cheer and fight stress, especially during exams. These are not service animals trained to help people with disabilities; most are the pets of volunteers. Their visits are obviously beneficial: Research shows that contact with pets can decrease blood pressure and stress­hormone levels and increase so­called happiness hormones. Mary Callahan, a director at Pet Partners, considers pet visits on campus a great way to support students on their path to success. ① What Is a Service Animal? ② How Hormones Affect Your Mood ③ Pets: A Solution for Stressed Students ④ Once You Volunteer, Others Will Join You ⑤ Managing Emotions Improves School Grades 24. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? This graph shows the number of Korean visitors to New Zealand according to their travel purpose in October of 2013, 2014, and 2015. ①Over the given period, the most popular purpose of visiting New Zealand was visiting friends and relatives. ②Visitors for the purpose of education declined from 2013 to 2014, but then increased in the following year. ③The number of Korean visitors with business interests in 2014 dropped compared with that in the previous year. ④Education was the least popular travel purpose for all three years. ⑤The number of people visiting friends and relatives in 2013 was more than double the number of those visiting for business purposes in 2013. 영어영역 4 고1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4 8 25. Joshua tree에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Joshua trees are evergreen, with numerous, sharp­pointed leaves at the ends of their branches. The unique appearance of the Joshua tree makes it a very desirable decoration. Unfortunately, many Joshua trees have been dug up to be planted in urban areas, despite a very low rate of survival when removed and planted in other places. Native Americans roasted and ate their flower buds. Young seeds were eaten raw or cooked (and said to taste like bananas). Alcoholic drinks were made from their flowers, too. But Joshua trees are hard to eat by today’s standards, and have little possibility of ever becoming a commercial food crop because they are protected by law. ① 뾰족한 잎을 가지고 있다. ② 옮겨 심을 경우 생존율이 매우 낮다. ③ 어린 씨앗은 식용으로 사용되었다. ④ 꽃으로 술을 만들 수 있었다. ⑤ 상업적인 식용 작물이 될 가능성이 크다. 26.

[3점] A lot of customers buy products only after they are made aware that the products are available in the market. Let’s say a product, even if it has been out there for a while, is not (A) advertising / advertised . Then what might happen? Not knowing that the product exists, customers would probably not buy it even if the product may have worked for (B) it / them . Advertising also helps people find the best for themselves. When they are made aware of a whole range of goods, they are able to compare them and make purchases so that they get (C) that / what they desire with their hard­earned money. Thus, advertising has become a necessity in everybody’s daily life. (A) (B) (C) ①advertising …… it …… that ②advertising …… them …… what ③advertised …… them …… what ④advertised …… it …… what ⑤advertised …… them …… that 영어영역 고1 5 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 5 8 29.

That is because a baby’s vision has not developed enough to focus on the screen, and they can’t even sit up on their own. But after their first birthday, people have different answers to the question. Some people (B) agree / disagree with the idea of exposing three­year­olds to computers. They insist that parents stimulate their children in the traditional ways through reading, sports, and play ― instead of computers. Others argue that early exposure to computers is helpful in adapting to our digital world.

An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his boss of his plans to leave the house­building business to live a more leisurely life with ①his family. He would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire. The boss was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if ②he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that ③his heart was not in his work. He used poor materials and didn’t put much time or effort into his last work. It was an unfortunate way to end his lifelong career. When ④he finished his work, his boss came to check out the house. Then ⑤he handed the front­door key to the worker and said, “This is your house, my gift to you.” [31~33] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. Perhaps the biggest mistake that most investors make when they first begin investing is getting into a panic over losses. This is a major obstacle to making a strong and long­lasting plan. We work hard for our money, and we want to see it grow and work hard for us. But what most beginning investors don’t understand is that investing in the stock market is a risk, and that with risk, you sometimes take losses. Although an investment may be falling in price, it doesn’t mean you have to abandon it in a rush. The point is, as investors, we should not focus on short­term losses, but rather on long­term growth. Therefore, be when it comes to not only your stock portfolio but to personal investments as well. * stock: 주식, 증권 ① honest ② patient ③ productive ④ diligent ⑤ cooperative 32. People have . For example, a person might buy a bottle of water, but after reading an article on possible risks of plastic bottles, that same person might avoid an identical bottle of water the next day. When a year later this same person flies to an anti­plastics conference and crashes in the desert, a plastic bottle of water might suddenly become one of the most valuable things in the universe ― to that person, at that time, and in that place. This person shows a preference for one thing over another and demonstrates a ranking and ordering of values with every choice and every action. [3점] ① economic freedom of choice ② smart strategies on consumption ③ different reactions to natural disasters ④ their own ways of saving the environment ⑤ changing values depending on the situation 영어영역 6 고1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 6 8 33. In philosophy, the best way to understand the concept of an argument is to contrast it with an opinion. An opinion is simply a belief or attitude about someone or something. We express our opinions all the time: We love or hate certain films or different types of food. For the most part, people’s opinions are based almost always upon their feelings. They don’t feel they have to support their opinions with any kind of evidence. An argument is something a bit different from this. It is made to convince others that one’s claims are true. Thus, it is an attempt to . Arguments are the building blocks of philosophy, and the good philosopher is one who is able to create the best arguments based on a solid foundation. [3점] ① present reasons in support of one’s claims ② develop one’s own taste in each area ③ compare one’s opinions with others’ ④ look into a deeper meaning of a topic ⑤ build up knowledge from one’s experiences 34. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? Finding the perfect shoe fit may be difficult for some people. Most adults think they know their exact foot size, so they don’t measure their feet when buying new shoes. (A) , many people squeeze into the same shoe size for years, or even decades. While feet stop growing in length by age twenty, most feet gradually widen with age, and sometimes women’s feet “grow” after the birth of a child. (B) , your feet can actually be different sizes at different times of the day, getting larger and returning to “normal” by the next morning. So, the next time you buy shoes, remember that your foot size can change. (A) (B) ①Therefore …… Besides ②Therefore …… For instance ③Otherwise …… Nevertheless ④In contrast …… Similarly ⑤In contrast …… However [35~36] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 35. The habit of reading books multiple times encourages people to engage with them emotionally. If they only read a book once, they tend to only focus on the events and stories in it. (A) The same effect can be seen with familiar holiday destinations. Re­visiting a place can also help people better understand both the place and themselves. Considering the immense benefits, don’t hesitate to give re­consuming a try. (B) By enjoying the emotional effects of the book more deeply, people become more in touch with their own feelings. Despite their familarity with the stories, re­reading brings renewed understanding of both the book and themselves. (C) But with a second read­through, the repeated experience brings back the initial emotions caused by the book, and allows people to appreciate those emotions at their leisure. [3점] ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 36. To rise, a fish must reduce its overall density, and most fish do this with a swim bladder. (A) Most fish rise using this method, but not all do. Some species don’t need a swim bladder because they spend all their lives moving along the ocean floor. Other fish float and sink by propelling themselves forward. (B) A fish fills its bladder with oxygen collected from the surrounding water. As it is filled, the bladder expands. Then, the fish has a greater volume, but its weight is not greatly increased. (C) This means that its density has been decreasing, so the fish experiences a greater rising force. Finally, when the bladder is fully expanded, the fish is at its maximum volume and is pushed to the surface. * density: 밀도 ** swim bladder: (물고기의) 부레 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 영어영역 고1 7 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 7 8 [37~38] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오. 37. In behavior capture, however, you first have to wait until your dog performs the behavior you want him to. The technique I use to train my puppy is called behavior capture which is different from the common training method. ( ① ) Normally you first give an order and reward your puppy only when he follows it. ( ② ) Simply watch your puppy’s activities, waiting for a particular behavior to occur; when one happens, reward him. ( ③ ) For example, if you want to train him to lie down whenever you say, “Lie down,” you just have to wait until he happens to do so. ( ④ ) Then, as soon as your puppy lies down, you give him the order, “Lie down,” and give him a treat as a reward. ( ⑤ ) Once the puppy knows that there is a reward waiting, he treats the experience as a pleasant game. 38. But people sometimes use reason in a different sense to mean something like ‘purpose.’ People sometimes say, ‘Everything happens for a reason.’ In one sense this is true. ( ① ) Everything does happen for a reason ― which is to say that events have causes, and the cause always comes before the event. ( ② ) Tsunamis happen because of undersea earthquakes, and earthquakes happen because of shifts in the earth’s plates. ( ③ ) That is the true sense of ‘everything happens for a reason,’ and here ‘reason’ means ‘past cause.’ ( ④ ) They will say something like, ‘The reason for the tsunami was to punish us for our faults.’ ( ⑤ ) It is surprising how often people depend on this kind of nonsense. [3점] * tsunami: (지진 등에 의한) 엄청난 해일 39. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? In an experiment, when people were asked to count three minutes in their heads, 25­year­olds were quite accurate, but 65­year­olds went over on average by 40 seconds. Time seemed to pass faster for the older group. ①This may seem meaningless, but there are a lot of benefits to perceiving time like 65­year­olds. ②For example, if you have been working on a project for eight hours, but it only feels like six, you will have more energy to keep going. ③If you have been running for 20 minutes, and you perceive it to be only 13 minutes, you’re more likely to have seven more minutes of energy. ④One of the greatest benefits of getting older is the cooling of passion ― not rushing to quick action. ⑤So, if you want to use your energy to work longer, just change your perception of how long you have been working. 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A)와 (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? In one study, researchers asked students to arrange ten posters in order of beauty. They promised that afterward the students could have one of the ten posters as a reward for their participation. However, when the students finished the task, the researchers said that the students were not allowed to keep the poster that they had rated as the third­most beautiful. Then, they asked the students to judge all ten posters again from the very beginning. What happened was that the poster they were unable to keep was suddenly ranked as the most beautiful. This is an example of the “Romeo and Juliet effect”: Just like Romeo and Juliet in the Shakespearean tragedy, people become more attached to each other when their love is prohibited. 󰀻 When people find they cannot (A) something, they begin to think it more (B) . (A) (B) ①own …… attractive ②own …… forgettable ③create …… charming ④create …… romantic ⑤accept …… disappointing 영어영역 8 고1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 8 8 [41~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. Last year, Roberta Vinci had a tennis match with No. 1­ranked Serena Williams in the US Open. No one thought Vinci would win, but she did. In an interview after the match, Vinci said she did not think it was possible, so she tried not to think about winning. “In my mind I said, ‘Hit the ball and run. Don’t think, just run.’ And then I won.” Vinci’s attitude stands strongly against today’s culture where we emphasize positivity too much. If you are feeling like something is impossible, then you are told that you are just not thinking positively enough. However, if you really believe that something is impossible, or that you won’t succeed, then trying to convince yourself otherwise can increase your anxiety, and actually doesn’t help at all. Therefore, sometimes the best way to accomplish a difficult objective is to stop thinking that it is possible, and just take things one step at a time. Remember, focusing too much on the can prevent you from achieving the thing you want. Forget about it. Just hit the ball, and run. 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① The Power of Positive Thinking ② Stop Thinking, Be in the Moment ③ Keep Your Original Plan on Track ④ Physical Activity Reduces Anxiety ⑤ Want to Succeed?

He was an orphan, and not knowing where to turn for money, he came up with a bright idea. He decided to host a music concert on campus to raise money for his education. He asked the great pianist Ignacy Paderewski to come and play. (a) His manager demanded $2,000 for the piano recital. A deal was struck and the student began working to make the concert a success. (B) Paderewski later went on to become the Prime Minister of Poland. He was a great leader, but unfortunately when World War Ⅰ began, Poland was ravaged. There were more than 1.5 million people starving in (b) his country, and there was no money to feed them. Paderewski did not know where to turn for help. Finally, he asked the US Food and Relief Administration for help. * ravaged: 황폐하게 된 (C) The head there was a man called Herbert Hoover ―who later went on to become the US President. (c) He agreed to supply tons of food to the starving Polish people. Paderewski was relieved. Later, when (d) he began to thank Hoover for his noble gesture, Hoover quickly said, “You shouldn’t be thanking me, Mr. Prime Minister. You may not remember this, but many years ago, you helped a student make it through college. I was him.” (D) The big day arrived. But unfortunately, he had not managed to sell enough tickets. The total amount collected was only $1,600. Disappointed, he went to Paderewski and explained his difficulty. Paderewski returned the $1,600 and told the student: “Here’s the $1,600. Keep the money you need for your fees.” The student was surprised, and thanked (e) him heartily. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a) ~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) 45. 윗글의 Ignacy Paderewski에 관한 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? ① 학생으로부터 연주 요청을 받았다. ② 나중에 폴란드의 수상이 되었다. ③ 미국에 도움을 요청했다. ④ Hoover로부터 학비를 지원받았다. ⑤ 학생에게 1,600달러를 되돌려 주었다. ※ 확인 사항 ◦답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기) 했는지 확인하시오."
