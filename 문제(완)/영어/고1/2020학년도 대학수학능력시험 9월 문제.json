Dear Wildwood residents, Wildwood Academy is a local school that seeks to help children with disabilities and learning challenges. We currently have over 200 students enrolled. This year we’d like to add a music class in the hope that each of our students will have the opportunity to develop their musical abilities. To get the class started, we need more instruments than we have now. We are asking you to look around your house and donate any instruments that you may no longer use. Each one donated will be assigned to a student in need. Simply call us and we will be happy to drop by and pick up the instrument.

Salva had to raise money for a project to help southern Sudan. It was the first time that Salva spoke in front of an audience. There were more than a hundred people. Salva’s knees were shaking as he walked to the microphone. “H-h-hello,” he said. His hands trembling, he looked out at the audience. Everyone was looking at him. At that moment, he noticed that every face looked interested in what he had to say. People were smiling and seemed friendly. That made him feel a little better, so he spoke into the microphone again. “Hello,” he repeated. He smiled, feeling at ease, and went on. “I am here to talk to you about a project for southern Sudan.” ① nervous → relieved ② indifferent → excited ③ worried → disappointed ④ satisfied → frustrated ⑤ confident → embarrassed 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? Any goal you set is going to be difficult to achieve, and you will certainly be disappointed at some points along the way. So why not set your goals much higher than you consider worthy from the beginning? If they are going to require work, effort, and energy, then why not exert 10 times as much of each? What if you are underestimating your capabilities? You might be protesting, saying, “What of the disappointment that comes from setting unrealistic goals?” However, take just a few moments to look back over your life. Chances are that you have more often been disappointed by setting targets that are too low and achieving them ― only to be shocked that you still didn’t get what you wanted. * exert: 발휘하다 ① 매사에 최선을 다하는 태도를 가져야 한다. ② 목표는 자신의 생각보다 높게 설정해야 한다. ③ 변화하는 상황에 따라 목표를 수정해야 한다. ④ 과거의 실패를 되돌아보는 습관을 길러야 한다. ⑤ 목표 달성을 위해 계획을 구체적으로 세워야 한다. 고1 영어영역 3 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 have that same scenario가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] There are more than 700 million cell phones used in the US today and at least 140 million of those cell phone users will abandon their current phone for a new phone every 14-18 months. I’m not one of those people who just “must” have the latest phone. Actually, I use my cell phone until the battery no longer holds a good charge. At that point, it’s time. So I figure I’ll just get a replacement battery. But I’m told that battery is no longer made and the phone is no longer manufactured because there’s newer technology and better features in the latest phones. That’s a typical justification. The phone wasn’t even that old; maybe a little over one year? I’m just one example. Can you imagine how many countless other people have that same scenario? No wonder cell phones take the lead when it comes to “e­waste.” ① have frequent trouble updating programs ② cannot afford new technology due to costs ③ spend a lot of money repairing their cell phones ④ are driven to change their still usable cell phones ⑤ are disappointed with newly launched phone models 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Learners function within complex developmental, cognitive, physical, social, and cultural systems. Research and theory from diverse fields have contributed to an evolving understanding that all learners grow and learn in culturally defined ways in culturally defined contexts. While humans share basic brain structures and processes, as well as fundamental experiences such as relationships with family, age­related stages, and many more, each of these phenomena is shaped by an individual’s precise experiences. Learning does not happen in the same way for all people because cultural influences are influential from the beginning of life. These ideas about the intertwining of learning and culture have been supported by research on many aspects of learning and development. * intertwine: 뒤얽히다 ① 문화 다양성에 대한 체계적 연구가 필요하다. ② 개인의 문화적 경험이 학습에 영향을 끼친다. ③ 인간의 뇌 구조는 학습을 통해 복잡하게 진화했다. ④ 원만한 대인관계 형성은 건강한 성장의 토대가 된다. ⑤ 학습 발달 단계에 적합한 자극을 제공하는 것이 좋다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? Animals as well as humans engage in play activities. In animals, play has long been seen as a way of learning and practicing skills and behaviors that are necessary for future survival. In children, too, play has important functions during development. From its earliest beginnings in infancy, play is a way in which children learn about the world and their place in it. Children’s play serves as a training ground for developing physical abilities ― skills like walking, running, and jumping that are necessary for everyday living. Play also allows children to try out and learn social behaviors and to acquire values and personality traits that will be important in adulthood. For example, they learn how to compete and cooperate with others, how to lead and follow, how to make decisions, and so on. ① necessity of trying out creative ideas ② roles of play in children’s development ③ contrasts between human and animal play ④ effects of children’s physical abilities on play ⑤ children’s needs at various developmental stages 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? The loss of many traditional jobs in everything from art to healthcare will partly be offset by the creation of new human jobs. Primary care doctors who focus on diagnosing known diseases and giving familiar treatments will probably be replaced by AI doctors. But precisely because of that, there will be much more money to pay human doctors and lab assistants to do groundbreaking research and develop new medicines or surgical procedures. AI might help create new human jobs in another way. Instead of humans competing with AI, they could focus on servicing and using AI. For example, the replacement of human pilots by drones has eliminated some jobs but created many new opportunities in maintenance, remote control, data analysis, and cyber security. * offset: 상쇄하다 ① What Makes Robots Smarter? ② Is AI Really a Threat to Your Job? ③ Watch Out! AI Can Read Your Mind ④ Future Jobs: Less Work, More Gains ⑤ Ongoing Challenges for AI Development 4 영어영역 고1 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The graph above shows the final energy consumption for indoor cooling by country/region in 2016. ①The global final energy consumption for indoor cooling was over three times larger in 2016 than in 1990. ②It was the United States that had the largest final energy consumption, which amounted to 616 TWh. ③The combined amount of the final energy consumption of the European Union, the Middle East, and Japan was less than the amount of China’s final energy consumption. ④The difference in amount between India’s and South Korea’s final energy consumption was more than 60 TWh. ⑤Indonesia’s final energy consumption was the smallest among the countries/regions above, totaling 25 TWh. 26. Jessie Redmon Fauset에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Jessie Redmon Fauset was born in Snow Hill, New Jersey, in 1884. She was the first black woman to graduate from Cornell University. In addition to writing novels, poetry, short stories, and essays, Fauset taught French in public schools in Washington, D.C. and worked as a journal editor. While working as an editor, she encouraged many well­known writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Though she is more famous for being an editor than for being a fiction writer, many critics consider her novel Plum Bun Fauset’s strongest work. In it, she tells the story of a black girl who could pass for white but ultimately claims her racial identity and pride. Fauset died of heart disease April 30, 1961, in Philadelphia. * pass for: ∼으로 여겨지다 ① Cornell University를 졸업한 최초의 흑인 여성이었다. ② Washington, D.C.의 공립학교에서 프랑스어를 가르쳤다. ③ 편집자보다는 소설가로서 더 유명하다. ④ 흑인 소녀의 이야기를 다룬 소설을 썼다. ⑤ Philadelphia에서 심장병으로 사망했다. 27.

[3점] Although it is obvious that part of our assessment of food is its visual appearance, it is perhaps surprising ①how visual input can override taste and smell. People find it very ②difficult to correctly identify fruit­flavoured drinks if the colour is wrong, for instance an orange drink that is coloured green. Perhaps even more striking ③is the experience of wine tasters. One study of Bordeaux University students of wine and wine making revealed that they chose tasting notes appropriate for red wines, such as ‘prune and chocolate’, when they ④gave white wine coloured with a red dye. Experienced New Zealand wine experts were similarly tricked into thinking ⑤that the white wine Chardonnay was in fact a red wine, when it had been coloured with a red dye. * override: ~에 우선하다 ** prune: 자두 30. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] Social connections are so essential for our survival and well­being that we not only cooperate with others to build relationships, we also compete with others for friends. And often we do both at the same time. Take gossip. Through gossip, we bond with our friends, sharing interesting details. But at the same time, we are (A) creating / forgiving potential enemies in the targets of our gossip. Or consider rival holiday parties where people compete to see who will attend their party. We can even see this (B) harmony / tension in social media as people compete for the most friends and followers. At the same time, competitive exclusion can also (C) generate / prevent cooperation. High school social clubs and country clubs use this formula to great effect: It is through selective inclusion and exclusion that they produce loyalty and lasting social bonds. (A) (B) (C) ①creating …… harmony …… prevent ②creating …… tension …… generate ③creating …… tension …… prevent ④forgiving …… tension …… prevent ⑤forgiving …… harmony …… generate [31~34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. As the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, approached, 9/11­related media stories peaked in the days immediately surrounding the anniversary date and then dropped off rapidly in the weeks thereafter. Surveys conducted during those times asked citizens to choose two “especially important” events from the past seventy years. Two weeks prior to the anniversary, before the media blitz began, about 30 percent of respondents named 9/11. But as the anniversary drew closer, and the media treatment intensified, survey respondents started identifying 9/11 in increasing numbers ― to a high of 65 percent. Two weeks later, though, after reportage had decreased to earlier levels, once again only about 30 percent of the participants placed it among their two especially important events of the past seventy years. Clearly, the of news coverage can make a big difference in the perceived significance of an issue among observers as they are exposed to the coverage. * blitz: 대선전, 집중 공세 ① accuracy ② tone ③ amount ④ source ⑤ type 32. Here’s the unpleasant truth: we are all biased. Every human being is affected by unconscious biases that lead us to make incorrect assumptions about other people. Everyone. To a certain extent, bias is a(n) . If you’re an early human, perhaps Homo Erectus, walking around the jungles, you may see an animal approaching. You have to make very fast assumptions about whether that animal is safe or not, based solely on its appearance. The same is true of other humans. You make split­second decisions about threats in order to have plenty of time to escape, if necessary. This could be one root of our tendency to categorize and label others based on their looks and their clothes. ① necessary survival skill ② origin of imagination ③ undesirable mental capacity ④ barrier to relationships ⑤ challenge to moral judgment 6 영어영역 고1 6 8 33. In Dutch bicycle culture, it is common to have a passenger on the backseat. So as to follow the rider’s movements, the person on the backseat needs to hold on tightly. Bicycles turn not just by steering but also by leaning, so the passenger needs to lean the same way as the rider. A passenger who would keep sitting up straight would literally be a pain in the behind. On motorcycles, this is even more critical. Their higher speed requires more leaning on turns, and lack of coordination can be disastrous. The passenger is a true partner in the ride, expected to . [3점] ① warn other people of danger ② stop the rider from speeding ③ mirror the rider’s every move ④ relieve the rider’s emotional anxiety ⑤ monitor the road conditions carefully 34. We’re often told that newborns and infants are comforted by rocking because this motion is similar to what they experienced in the womb, and that they must take comfort in this familiar feeling. This may be true; however, to date there are no convincing data that demonstrate a significant relationship between the amount of time a mother moves during pregnancy and her newborn’s response to rocking. Just as likely is the idea that newborns come to associate gentle rocking with being fed. Parents understand that rocking quiets a newborn, and they very often provide gentle, repetitive movement during feeding. Since the appearance of food is a primary reinforcer, newborns may because they have been conditioned through a process of associative learning. [3점] * womb: 자궁 ** reinforcer: 강화물 ① acquire a fondness for motion ② want consistent feeding ③ dislike severe rocking ④ remember the tastes of food ⑤ form a bond with their mothers 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? In a single week, the sun delivers more energy to our planet than humanity has used through the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas through all of human history. And the sun will keep shining on our planet for billions of years. ①Our challenge isn’t that we’re running out of energy. ②It’s that we have been focused on the wrong source ― the small, finite one that we’re using up. ③Indeed, all the coal, natural gas, and oil we use today is just solar energy from millions of years ago, a very tiny part of which was preserved deep underground. ④Our efforts to develop technologies that use fossil fuels have shown meaningful results. ⑤Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to learn to efficiently and cheaply use the much more abundant source that is the new energy striking our planet each day from the sun. [36~37] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 36. We make decisions based on what we think we know. It wasn’t too long ago that the majority of people believed the world was flat. (A) It wasn’t until that minor detail was revealed ─the world is round ─that behaviors changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies began to travel across the planet. Trade routes were established; spices were traded. (B) This perceived truth impacted behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. People feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of the earth. So for the most part they didn’t dare to travel. (C) New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies which allowed for all kinds of innovations and advancements. The correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race forward. ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 고1 영어영역 7 7 8 37. Mirrors and other smooth, shiny surfaces reflect light. We see reflections from such surfaces because the rays of light form an image on the retina of our eyes. (A) Keep your eyes on the reflected image while you are writing and not on your paper. After a little practice, it will be easier to write “backwards.” When your friend receives such a message he will be able to read it by holding the paper up to a mirror. (B) Stand a mirror upright on the table, so that a piece of paper on the table can be clearly seen in the mirror. Now write a message that looks right when you look in the mirror. (C) Such images are always reversed. Look at yourself in a mirror, wink your right eye and your left eye seems to wink back at you. You can use a mirror to send a coded message to a friend. * retina: (눈의) 망막 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) [38~39] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오. 38. The few times that they do occur, it is the possessor who tries to make someone leave the circle. Reciprocity can be explored in captivity by handing one chimpanzee a large amount of food, such as a watermelon or leafy branch, and then observing what follows. ( ①) The owner will be center stage, with a group of others around him or her, soon to be followed by newly formed groups around those who obtained a sizable share, until all food has been distributed. ( ②) Beggars may complain and cry, but aggressive conflicts are rare. ( ③) She will hit them over their head with her branch or bark at them in a high­pitched voice until they leave her alone. ( ④) Whatever their rank, possessors control the food flow. ( ⑤) Once chimpanzees enter reciprocity mode, their social rank no longer matters. [3점] * reciprocity: 호혜주의, 상호의 이익 39. However, we live in a society where gender roles and boundaries are not as strict as in prior generations. Gender research shows a complex relationship between gender and conflict styles. ( ①) Some research suggests that women from Western cultures tend to be more caring than men. ( ②) This tendency may result from socialization processes in which women are encouraged to care for their families and men are encouraged to be successful in competitive work environments. ( ③) There is significant variability in assertiveness and cooperation among women, as well as among men. ( ④) Although conflict resolution experts should be able to recognize cultural and gender differences, they should also be aware of within­group variations and the risks of stereotyping. ( ⑤) Culture and gender may affect the way people perceive, interpret, and respond to conflict; however, we must be careful to avoid overgeneralizations and to consider individual differences. 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? One way that music could express emotion is simply through a learned association. Perhaps there is nothing naturally sad about a piece of music in a minor key, or played slowly with low notes. Maybe we have just come to hear certain kinds of music as sad because we have learned to associate them in our culture with sad events like funerals. If this view is correct, we should have difficulty interpreting the emotions expressed in culturally unfamiliar music. Totally opposed to this view is the position that the link between music and emotion is one of resemblance. For example, when we feel sad we move slowly and speak slowly and in a low­pitched voice. Thus when we hear slow, low music, we hear it as sad. If this view is correct, we should have little difficulty understanding the emotion expressed in culturally unfamiliar music.  It is believed that emotion expressed in music can be understood through a(n) (A) learned association or it can be understood due to the (B) between music and emotion.

A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard bedding and clothing. This (a) surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort. Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their gender and age. But like calorie recommendations, it’s a good target for the average human being. Most of us set bedroom temperatures higher than are ideal for good sleep and this likely contributes to (b) lower quantity and quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used. However, most of us fall into the (c) opposite category of setting a controlled bedroom temperature that is too high: 70 or 72 degrees. Sleep clinicians treating patients who can’t sleep at night will often ask about room temperature, and will advise patients to (d) raise their current thermostat set­point by 3 to 5 degrees from that which they currently use. Anyone disbelieving of the influence of temperature on sleep can explore some related experiments on this topic. Scientists have, for example, gently warmed the feet or the body of rats to encourage blood to rise to the surface of the skin and release heat, thereby decreasing core body temperature. The rats fell asleep far (e) faster than was otherwise normal. * thermostat: 온도 조절 장치 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① Signs of Sleep Problems ② Stay Cool for Better Sleep ③ Turn Up the Heat in Your Room ④ How to Correct Bad Sleeping Posture ⑤ A Key to Quality Sleep: Clean Bedding 42. 밑줄 친 (a)～(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?

The boys worked for their father in the store he owned and when he died, they took over the store. Everything went well until the day a twenty­dollar bill disappeared. One of the brothers had left the bill on the counter and walked outside with a friend. When he returned, the money was gone. (a) He asked his older brother, “Did you see that twenty­dollar bill on the counter?” (B) Then one day a man from another state stopped by the store. He walked in and asked the younger brother, “How long have you been here?” (b) He replied that he’d been there all his life. The customer said, “Twenty years ago I came into this town in a boxcar. I hadn’t eaten for three days. I came into this store and saw a twenty­dollar bill on the counter. I put it in my pocket and walked out. All these years I haven’t been able to forgive myself. So I had to come back to return it.” (C) His older brother replied that he had not. But (c) the young man kept questioning him. “Twenty­dollar bills just don’t get up and walk away! Surely you must have seen it!” There was subtle accusation in (d) his voice. Anger began to rise. Hatred set in. Before long, bitterness divided the twins. They refused to speak. They finally decided they could no longer work together and a dividing wall was built down the center of the store. For twenty years the hostility grew, spreading to their families and the community.
