Dear Ms. Sue Jones, As you know, it is our company’s policy that all new employees must gain experience in all departments.

It was my first day of school at St. Roma High School. The uniforms were a lot fancier than in middle school. As a St. Roma student, I had to wear a green sweater with the school label on the shoulder, khaki skirt or khaki pants, a white blouse, and a green St. Roma tie. “There’s my St. Roma student,” said Mom. “You’re ready for your first day?” she asked. “Yes!” I told her. When we got into the car and headed to school, my mind started to imagine how my first day of school would turn out. Maybe I’ll have new friends. Maybe I’ll be the best in the class. I could not wait to start my first day at a new school. ① angry ② excited ③ jealous ④ regretful ⑤ disappointed 20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? While some sand is formed in oceans from things like shells and rocks, most sand is made up of tiny bits of rock that came all the way from the mountains! But that trip can take thousands of years. Glaciers, wind, and flowing water help move the rocky bits along, with the tiny travelers getting smaller and smaller as they go. If they’re lucky, a river may give them a lift all the way to the coast. There, they can spend the rest of their years on the beach as sand. ① things to cause the travel of water ② factors to determine the size of sand ③ how most sand on the beach is formed ④ many uses of sand in various industries ⑤ why sand is disappearing from the beach 영어영역 3 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3 8 21. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? It can be tough to settle down to study when there are so many distractions. Most young people like to combine a bit of homework with quite a lot of instant messaging, chatting on the phone, updating profiles on social­networking sites, and checking emails. While it may be true that you can multi­task and can focus on all these things at once, try to be honest with yourself. It is most likely that you will be able to work best if you concentrate on your studies but allow yourself regular breaks — every 30 minutes or so — to catch up on those other pastimes. ① 공부할 때는 공부에만 집중하라. ② 평소 주변 사람들과 자주 연락하라. ③ 피로감을 느끼지 않게 충분한 휴식을 취하라. ④ 자투리 시간을 이용하여 숙제를 하라. ⑤ 학습에 유익한 취미 활동을 하라. 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? According to professor Jacqueline Olds, there is one sure way for lonely patients to make a friend — to join a group that has a shared purpose. This may be difficult for people who are lonely, but research shows that it can help. Studies reveal that people who are engaged in service to others, such as volunteering, tend to be happier. Volunteers report a sense of satisfaction at enriching their social network in the service of others. Volunteering helps to reduce loneliness in two ways. First, someone who is lonely might benefit from helping others. Also, they might benefit from being involved in a voluntary program where they receive support and help to build their own social network. ① 외로움을 극복하는 데는 봉사 활동이 유익하다. ② 한 가지 봉사 활동을 지속적으로 하는 것이 좋다. ③ 봉사 활동은 진로를 탐색할 수 있는 기회를 제공한다. ④ 행복한 삶을 위해서는 혼자만의 시간이 필요하다. ⑤ 먼저 자신을 이해해야 남을 위해 봉사할 수 있다. 23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Simply providing students with complex texts is not enough for learning to happen. Assigning students to independently read, think about, and then write about a complex text is not enough, either. Quality questions are one way that teachers can check students’ understanding of the text. Questions can also promote students’ search for evidence and their need to return to the text to deepen their understanding. Teachers take an active role in developing and deepening students’ comprehension by asking questions that cause them to read the text again, resulting in multiple readings of the same text. In other words, these text­based questions provide students with a purpose for rereading, which is critical for understanding complex texts. ① Too Much Homework Is Harmful ② Questioning for Better Comprehension ③ Too Many Tests Make Students Tired ④ Questions That Science Can’t Answer Yet ⑤ There Is Not Always Just One Right Answer 24. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The above graph shows how people in five countries consume news videos: on news sites versus via social networks. ①Consuming news videos on news sites is more popular than via social networks in four countries. ②As for people who mostly watch news videos on news sites, Finland shows the highest percentage among the five countries. ③The percentage of people who mostly watch news videos on news sites in France is higher than that in Germany. ④As for people who mostly watch news videos via social networks, Japan shows the lowest percentage among the five countries. ⑤Brazil shows the highest percentage of people who mostly watch news videos via social networks among the five countries. 영어영역 4 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4 8 25. Shirley Chisholm에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Shirley Chisholm was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1924. Chisholm spent part of her childhood in Barbados with her grandmother. Shirley attended Brooklyn College and majored in sociology. After graduating from Brooklyn College in 1946, she began her career as a teacher and went on to earn a master’s degree in elementary education from Columbia University. In 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the United States’ first African­American congresswoman. She spoke out for civil rights, women’s rights, and poor people. Shirley Chisholm was against the American involvement in the Vietnam War and the expansion of weapon developments. ① 어린 시절에 할머니와 함께 지낸 적이 있다. ② Brooklyn 대학에서 사회학을 전공했다. ③ 대학 졸업 후 교사로 일하기 시작했다. ④ 미국 최초의 아프리카계 미국인 여성 하원 의원이었다. ⑤ 미국의 베트남 전쟁 개입을 지지했다. 26.

Let them know you respect their thinking, and let them (A) silence / voice their opinions. As an added bonus, you might learn something! A friend of mine once told me about the CEO of a large company who told one of his managers, “There’s nothing you could possibly tell me that I haven’t already thought about before. Don’t ever tell me what you think unless I ask you. Is that understood?” Imagine the (B) improvement / loss of self­esteem that manager must have felt.

[3점] Technology has doubtful advantages. We must balance too much information versus using only the right information and keeping the decision­making process simple. The Internet has made so much free information available on any issue that we think we have to consider all of it in order to make a decision. So we keep searching for answers on the Internet. This makes us information blinded, like deer in headlights, when trying to make personal, business, or other decisions. To be successful in anything today, we have to keep in mind that in the land of the blind, a one­eyed person can accomplish the seemingly impossible. The one­eyed person understands the power of keeping any analysis simple and will be the decision maker when he uses his one eye of intuition. * intuition: 직관 ① unwilling to accept others’ ideas ② unable to access free information ③ unable to make decisions due to too much information ④ indifferent to the lack of available information ⑤ willing to take risks in decision­making [31 ∼34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. Most of us are suspicious of rapid cognition. We believe that the quality of the decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it. That’s what we tell our children: “Haste makes waste.” “Look before you leap.” “Stop and think.” “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” We believe that we are always better off gathering as much information as possible and spending as much time as possible in careful consideration. But there are moments, particularly in time­driven, critical situations, when , when our snap judgments and first impressions can offer better means of making sense of the world. Survivors have somehow learned this lesson and have developed and sharpened their skill of rapid cognition. [3점] * cognition: 인식 ① haste does not make waste ② it is never too late to learn ③ many hands make light work ④ slow and steady wins the race ⑤ you don’t judge by appearances 32. All mammals need to leave their parents and set up on their own at some point. But human adults generally provide a comfortable existence ― enough food arrives on the table, money is given at regular intervals, the bills get paid and the electricity for the TV doesn’t usually run out. If teenagers didn’t build up a fairly major disrespect for and conflict with their parents or carers, they’d never want to leave. In fact, is probably a necessary part of growing up. Later, when you live independently, away from them, you can start to love them again because you won’t need to be fighting to get away from them. And you can come back sometimes for a home­cooked meal. [3점] ① developing financial management skills ② learning from other people’s experiences ③ figuring out your strengths and interests ④ managing relationship problems with your peers ⑤ falling out of love with the adults who look after you 영어영역 6 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 6 8 33. A lovely technique for helping children take the first steps towards creating their own, unique story, is to ask them to . One story I have done this with frequently is a tale I call Benno and the Beasts. It is based on a story called St. Benno and the Frog, found in an old book by Helen Waddell. In the original, the saint meets a frog in a marsh and tells it to be quiet in case it disturbs his prayers. Later, he regrets this, in case God was enjoying listening to the sound of the frog. I invite children to think of different animals for the saint to meet and different places for him to meet them. I then tell them the story including their own ideas. It is a most effective way of involving children in the art of creating stories and they love hearing their ideas used. [3점] * marsh: 늪 ① help you complete a story before you tell it ② choose some books they are interested in ③ read as many book reviews as possible ④ listen to a story and write a summary ⑤ draw a picture about their experience 34. It is difficult to know how to determine whether one culture is better than another. What is the cultural rank order of rock, jazz, and classical music? When it comes to public opinion polls about whether cultural changes are for the better or the worse, looking forward would lead to one answer and looking backward would lead to a very different answer. Our children would be horrified if they were told they had to go back to the culture of their grandparents. Our parents would be horrified if they were told they had to participate in the culture of their grandchildren. Humans tend to . After a certain age, anxieties arise when sudden cultural changes are coming. Our culture is part of who we are and where we stand, and we don’t like to think that who we are and where we stand are short­lived. [3점] ① seek cooperation between generations ② be forgetful of what they experienced ③ adjust quickly to the new environment ④ make efforts to remember what their ancestors did ⑤ like what they have grown up in and gotten used to 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Public speaking is audience centered because speakers “listen” to their audiences during speeches. They monitor audience feedback, the verbal and nonverbal signals an audience gives a speaker. ①Audience feedback often indicates whether listeners understand, have interest in, and are ready to accept the speaker’s ideas. ②This feedback assists the speaker in many ways. ③It helps the speaker know when to slow down, explain something more carefully, or even tell the audience that she or he will return to an issue in a question­and­answer session at the close of the speech. ④It is important for the speaker to memorize his or her script to reduce on­stage anxiety. ⑤Audience feedback assists the speaker in creating a respectful connection with the audience. * verbal: 언어적인 [36 ~ 37] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 36. The basic difference between an AI robot and a normal robot is the ability of the robot and its software to make decisions, and learn and adapt to its environment based on data from its sensors. (A) For instance, if faced with the same situation, such as running into an obstacle, then the robot will always do the same thing, such as go around the obstacle to the left. An AI robot, however, can do two things the normal robot cannot: make decisions and learn from experience. (B) It will adapt to circumstances, and may do something different each time a situation is faced. The AI robot may try to push the obstacle out of the way, or make up a new route, or change goals. (C) To be a bit more specific, the normal robot shows deterministic behaviors. That is, for a set of inputs, the robot will always produce the same output. [3점] * deterministic: 결정론적인 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 영어영역 7 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 7 8 37. Collaboration is the basis for most of the foundational arts and sciences. (A) For example, his sketches of human anatomy were a collaboration with Marcantonio della Torre, an anatomist from the University of Pavia. Their collaboration is important because it marries the artist with the scientist. (B) It is often believed that Shakespeare, like most playwrights of his period, did not always write alone, and many of his plays are considered collaborative or were rewritten after their original composition. Leonardo Da Vinci made his sketches individually, but he collaborated with other people to add the finer details. (C) Similarly, Marie Curie’s husband stopped his original research and joined Marie in hers. They went on to collaboratively discover radium, which overturned old ideas in physics and chemistry. * anatomy: 해부학적 구조 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) [38 ~ 39] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오. 38. This may have worked in the past, but today, with interconnected team processes, we don’t want all people who are the same. Most of us have hired many people based on human resources criteria along with some technical and personal information that the boss thought was important. ( ①) I have found that most people like to hire people just like themselves. ( ②) In a team, some need to be leaders, some need to be doers, some need to provide creative strengths, some need to be inspirers, some need to provide imagination, and so on. ( ③) In other words, we are looking for a diversified team where members complement one another. ( ④) When putting together a new team or hiring team members, we need to look at each individual and how he or she fits into the whole of our team objective. ( ⑤) The bigger the team, the more possibilities exist for diversity. * criteria: 기준 39. However, if you tried to copy the original rather than your imaginary drawing, you might find your drawing now was a little better. Imagine in your mind one of your favorite paintings, drawings, cartoon characters or something equally complex. ( ①) Now, with that picture in your mind, try to draw what your mind sees. ( ②) Unless you are unusually gifted, your drawing will look completely different from what you are seeing with your mind’s eye. ( ③) Furthermore, if you copied the picture many times, you would find that each time your drawing would get a little better, a little more accurate. ( ④) Practice makes perfect. ( ⑤) This is because you are developing the skills of coordinating what your mind perceives with the movement of your body parts. [3점] * coordinate ~ with ...: ~와 …을 조화시키다 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? In one experiment, subjects observed a person solve 30 multiple­choice problems. In all cases, 15 of the problems were solved correctly. One group of subjects saw the person solve more problems correctly in the first half and another group saw the person solve more problems correctly in the second half. The group that saw the person perform better on the initial examples rated the person as more intelligent and recalled that he had solved more problems correctly. The explanation for the difference is that one group formed the opinion that the person was intelligent on the initial set of data, while the other group formed the opposite opinion. Once this opinion is formed, when opposing evidence is presented it can be discounted by attributing later performance to some other cause such as chance or problem difficulty. * subject: 실험 대상자 ** attribute ~ to ...: ~을 …의 탓으로 돌리다  People tend to form an opinion based on (A) data, and when evidence against the opinion is presented, it is likely to be (B) .

Researchers brought two groups of 11­year­old boys to a summer camp at Robbers Cave State Park in Oklahoma. The boys were strangers to one another and upon arrival at the camp, were randomly separated into two groups. The groups were kept apart for about a week. They swam, camped, and hiked. Each group chose a name for itself, and the boys printed their group’s name on their caps and T­shirts. Then the two groups met. A series of athletic competitions were set up between them. Soon, each group considered the other an (a) enemy. Each group came to look down on the other. The boys started food fights and stole various items from members of the other group. Thus, under competitive conditions, the boys quickly (b) drew sharp group boundaries. The researchers next stopped the athletic competitions and created several apparent emergencies whose solution (c) required cooperation between the two groups. One such emergency involved a leak in the pipe supplying water to the camp. The researchers assigned the boys to teams made up of members of both groups. Their job was to look into the pipe and fix the leak. After engaging in several such (d) cooperative activities, the boys started playing together without fighting. Once cooperation replaced competition and the groups (e) started to look down on each other, group boundaries melted away as quickly as they had formed. * apparent: ~인 것으로 보이는 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① How Are Athletic Competitions Helpful for Teens? ② Preparation: The Key to Preventing Emergencies ③ What Makes Group Boundaries Disappear? ④ Respect Individual Differences in Teams ⑤ Free Riders: Headaches in Teams 42. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? ① (a) ② (b) ③ (c) ④ (d) ⑤ (e) [43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A) Feeling a tap on his shoulder while giving away food and supplies to people, eighteen­year­old Toby Long turned around to find an Ethiopian boy standing behind (a) him. The young boy looked first at his own worn shirt, then at Toby’s clothes. Next, he asked if he could have Toby’s shirt. Toby had traveled to Africa to volunteer for two­and­a­half weeks with an international charity. Toby didn’t know what to say to the little boy other than, “I need it, too.” (B) When Toby returned home to Michigan, he tried to keep his promise to make a difference in the lives of the people he had seen: (b) He organized a T­shirt drive in his community! Called “Give the Shirt Off Your Back,” Toby’s campaign soon collected over ten thousand T­shirts. His next challenge was as great or even greater than the T­shirts. It was to find an organization to pay the shipping costs for getting all those shirts to Ethiopia. (C) It was as difficult as the first challenge, too. He found SOS (Supporters of Sub­Saharan Africa). The organization agreed to transport the T­shirts on their next trip to Africa. “I think we can all make a difference,” said Toby. “I wonder if that little boy I met will get one of the ten thousand shirts, and I don’t know the answer. But I can pray that (c) he does or that someone who receives one will give it to him.” (D) When Toby returned to camp that evening (d) he couldn’t stop thinking about the little boy with the big sad eyes.
