Norm and his friend Jason went on a winter camping trip. In the middle of the night, Norm suddenly woke up sensing something was terribly wrong. To his surprise, the stove was glowing red! Norm shook Jason awake and told him to look at the stove. Jason said he had filled it with every piece of wood he could fit into it. Norm thought the cabin was going to catch fire. He started swearing at Jason. He pulled Jason out of his bed, opened the front door and threw him out into the snow. Norm yelled out in anger, “Don’t come back in until I get this stove cooled off!” ① alarmed and upset ② thrilled and joyful ③ touched and grateful ④ ashamed and guilty ⑤ encouraged and satisfied 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? We tend to go long periods of time without reaching out to the people we know. Then, we suddenly take notice of the distance that has formed and we scramble to make repairs. We call people we haven’t spoken to in ages, hoping that one small effort will erase the months and years of distance we’ve created. However, this rarely works: relationships aren’t kept up with big one-time fixes. They’re kept up with regular maintenance, like a car. In our relationships, we have to make sure that not too much time goes by between oil changes, so to speak. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t bother calling someone just because it’s been a while since you’ve spoken; just that it’s more ideal not to let yourself fall out of touch in the first place. Consistency always brings better results. ① 가까운 사이일수록 적당한 거리를 유지해야 한다. ② 사교성을 기르려면 개방적인 태도를 가져야 한다. ③ 대화를 할 때 상대방의 의견을 먼저 경청해야 한다. ④ 인간관계를 지속하려면 일관된 노력을 기울여야 한다. ⑤ 원활한 의사소통을 위해 솔직하게 감정을 표현해야 한다. To the Principal of Alamda High School, On behalf of the Youth Soccer Tournament Series, I would like to remind you of the 2019 Series next week. Surely, we understand the importance of a player’s education. Regrettably, however, the Series will result in players missing two days of school for the competition. The games will be attended by many college coaches scouting prospective student athletes. Therefore, the Series can be a great opportunity for young soccer players to demonstrate their capabilities as athletes. I would like to request your permission for the absence of the players from your school during this event. Thank you for your understanding.

[3점] There is a critical factor that determines whether your choice will influence that of others: the visible consequences of the choice. Take the case of the Adélie penguins. They are often found strolling in large groups toward the edge of the water in search of food. Yet danger awaits in the icy-cold water. There is the leopard seal, for one, which likes to have penguins for a meal. What is an Adélie to do? The penguins’ solution is to play the waiting game. They wait and wait and wait by the edge of the water until one of them gives up and jumps in. The moment that occurs, the rest of the penguins watch with anticipation to see what happens next. If the pioneer survives, everyone else will follow suit. If it perishes, they’ll turn away. One penguin’s destiny alters the fate of all the others. Their strategy, you could say, is “learn and live.” * perish: 죽다 ① occupy a rival’s territory for safety ② discover who the enemy is and attack first ③ share survival skills with the next generation ④ support the leader’s decisions for the best results ⑤ follow another’s action only when it is proven safe 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? How many of you have a hard time saying no? No matter what anyone asks of you, no matter how much of an inconvenience it poses for you, you do what they request. This is not a healthy way of living because by saying yes all the time you are building up emotions of inconvenience. You know what will happen in time? You will resent the person who you feel you cannot say no to because you no longer have control of your life and of what makes you happy. You are allowing someone else to have control over your life. When you are suppressed emotionally and constantly do things against your own will, your stress will eat you up faster than you can count to three. ① 거절하지 못하고 삶의 통제권을 잃으면 스트레스가 생긴다. ② 상대방의 거절을 감정적으로 해석하지 않는 것이 바람직하다. ③ 대부분의 스트레스는 상대에 대한 지나친 요구에서 비롯된다. ④ 일에 우선순위를 정해서 자신의 삶을 통제하는 것이 필요하다. ⑤ 사람마다 생각이 다를 수 있다는 점을 인정하는 것이 중요하다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? You can say that information sits in one brain until it is communicated to another, unchanged in the conversation. That’s true of sheer information, like your phone number or the place you left your keys. But it’s not true of knowledge. Knowledge relies on judgements, which you discover and polish in conversation with other people or with yourself. Therefore you don’t learn the details of your thinking until speaking or writing it out in detail and looking back critically at the result. “Is what I just said foolish, or is what I just wrote a deep truth?” In the speaking or writing, you uncover your bad ideas, often embarrassing ones, and good ideas too, sometimes fame-making ones. Thinking requires its expression. ① critical roles of speaking or writing in refining thoughts ② persuasive ways to communicate what you think to people ③ important tips to select the right information for your writing ④ positive effects of logical thinking on reading comprehension ⑤ enormous gaps between spoken language and written language 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? It is said that among the Bantu peoples of Central Africa, when an individual from one tribe meets someone from a different group, they ask, “What do you dance?” Throughout time, communities have forged their identities through dance rituals that mark major events in the life of individuals, including birth, marriage, and death ― as well as religious festivals and important points in the seasons. The social structure of many communities, from African tribes to Spanish gypsies, and to Scottish clans, gains much cohesion from the group activity of dancing. Historically, dance has been a strong, binding influence on community life, a means of expressing the social identity of the group, and participation allows individuals to demonstrate a belonging. As a consequence, in many regions of the world there are as many types of dances as there are communities with distinct identities. * forge: 구축하다 ** cohesion: 결속 ① What Makes Traditional Dance Hard to Learn? ② Dance: A Distinct Sign of Social Identity ③ The More Varieties, the Better Dances ④ Feeling Down? Enjoy Dancing! ⑤ The Origin of Tribal Dances 4 영어 영역 4 8 25. 다음 표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

George Boole에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? George Boole was born in Lincoln, England in 1815. Boole was forced to leave school at the age of sixteen after his father’s business collapsed. He taught himself mathematics, natural philosophy and various languages. He began to produce original mathematical research and made important contributions to areas of mathematics. For those contributions, in 1844, he was awarded a gold medal for mathematics by the Royal Society. Boole was deeply interested in expressing the workings of the human mind in symbolic form, and his two books on this subject, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic and An Investigation of the Laws of Thought form the basis of today’s computer science. In 1849, he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen’s College in Cork, Ireland and taught there until his death in 1864. ① 아버지의 사업 실패 후 학교를 그만두게 되었다. ② 수학, 자연 철학, 여러 언어를 독학했다. ③ Royal Society에서 화학으로 금메달을 받았다. ④ 오늘날 컴퓨터 과학의 기초를 형성한 책들을 저술했다. ⑤ Queen’s College의 교수로 임명되었다. 27.

[3점] Non-verbal communication is not a substitute for verbal communication. Rather, it should function as a supplement, ①serving to enhance the richness of the content of the message that is being passed across. Non-verbal communication can be useful in situations ②where speaking may be impossible or inappropriate. Imagine you are in an uncomfortable position while talking to an individual. Non-verbal communication will help you ③get the message across to him or her to give you some time off the conversation to be comfortable again. Another advantage of non-verbal communication is ④what it offers you the opportunity to express emotions and attitudes properly. Without the aid of non-verbal communication, there are several aspects of your nature and personality that will not be adequately expressed. So, again, it does not substitute verbal communication but rather ⑤complements it. * supplement: 보충 30. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? Intellectual humility is admitting you are human and there are limits to the knowledge you have. It involves (A) neglecting / recognizing that you possess cognitive and personal biases, and that your brain tends to see things in such a way that your opinions and viewpoints are favored above others. It is being willing to work to overcome those biases in order to be more objective and make informed decisions. People who display intellectual humility are more likely to be (B) receptive/ resistant to learning from others who think differently than they do. They tend to be well-liked and respected by others because they make it clear that they (C) value / undervalue what other people bring to the table. Intellectually humble people want to learn more and are open to finding information from a variety of sources. They are not interested in trying to appear or feel superior to others. (A) (B) (C) ①recognizing …… receptive …… value ②recognizing …… resistant …… undervalue ③recognizing …… receptive …… undervalue ④neglecting …… resistant …… undervalue ⑤neglecting …… receptive …… value [31 ~ 34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. People engage in typical patterns of interaction based on the relationship between their roles and the roles of others. Employers are expected to interact with employees in a certain way, as are doctors with patients. In each case, actions are restricted by the role responsibilities and obligations associated with individuals’ positions within society. For instance, parents and children are linked by certain rights, privileges, and obligations. Parents are responsible for providing their children with the basic necessities of life ― food, clothing, shelter, and so forth. These expectations are so powerful that not meeting them may make the parents vulnerable to charges of negligence or abuse. Children, in turn, are expected to do as their parents say. Thus, interactions within a relationship are functions not only of the individual personalities of the people involved but also of the role requirements associated with the they have. * vulnerable: 비난받기 쉬운 ** negligence: 태만 ① careers ② statuses ③ abilities ④ motivations ⑤ perspectives 32. The title of Thomas Friedman’s 2005 book, The World Is Flat, was based on the belief that globalization would inevitably bring us closer together. It has done that, but it has also inspired us . When faced with perceived threats ― the financial crisis, terrorism, violent conflict, refugees and immigration, the increasing gap between rich and poor ― people cling more tightly to their groups. One founder of a famous social media company believed social media would unite us. In some respects it has, but it has simultaneously given voice and organizational ability to new cyber tribes, some of whom spend their time spreading blame and division across the World Wide Web. There seem now to be as many tribes, and as much conflict between them, as there have ever been. Is it possible for these tribes to coexist in a world where the concept of “us and them” remains? [3점] ① to build barriers ② to achieve equality ③ to abandon traditions ④ to value individualism ⑤ to develop technologies 6 영어 영역 6 8 33. Focusing on the differences among societies conceals a deeper reality: their similarities are greater and more profound than their dissimilarities. Imagine studying two hills while standing on a ten-thousand-foot-high plateau. Seen from your perspective, one hill appears to be three hundred feet high, and the other appears to be nine hundred feet. This difference may seem large, and you might focus your attention on what local forces, such as erosion, account for the difference in size. But this narrow perspective misses the opportunity to study the other, more significant geological forces that created what are actually two very similar mountains, one 10,300 feet high and the other 10,900 feet. And when it comes to human societies, people have been standing on a ten-thousand-foot plateau, letting the differences among societies . [3점] * erosion: 침식 ① prove the uniqueness of each society ② prevent cross-cultural understanding ③ mask the more overwhelming similarities ④ change their perspective on what diversity is ⑤ encourage them to step out of their mental frame 34. There is a famous Spanish proverb that says, “The belly rules the mind.” This is a clinically proven fact. Food is the original mind-controlling drug. Every time we eat, we bombard our brains with a feast of chemicals, triggering an explosive hormonal chain reaction that directly influences the way we think. Countless studies have shown that the positive emotional state induced by a good meal . It triggers an instinctive desire to repay the provider. This is why executives regularly combine business meetings with meals, why lobbyists invite politicians to attend receptions, lunches, and dinners, and why major state occasions almost always involve an impressive banquet. Churchill called this “dining diplomacy,” and sociologists have confirmed that this principle is a strong motivator across all human cultures. [3점] * banquet: 연회 ① leads us to make a fair judgement ② interferes with cooperation with others ③ does harm to serious diplomatic occasions ④ plays a critical role in improving our health ⑤ enhances our receptiveness to be persuaded 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Training and conditioning for baseball focuses on developing strength, power, speed, quickness and flexibility. ①Before the 1980s, strength training was not an important part of conditioning for a baseball player. ②People viewed baseball as a game of skill and technique rather than strength, and most managers and coaches saw strength training as something for bodybuilders, not baseball players. ③Unlike more isolated bodybuilding exercises, athletic exercises train as many muscle groups and functions as possible at the same time. ④They feared that weight lifting and building large muscles would cause players to lose flexibility and interfere with quickness and proper technique. ⑤Today, though, experts understand the importance of strength training and have made it part of the game.

(A) After this, the salesperson asks you if you are interested in buying any cruelty-free cosmetics from their store. Given the fact that most people agree to the prior request to sign the petition, they will be more likely to purchase the cosmetics. (B) For instance, a salesperson might request you to sign a petition to prevent cruelty against animals. This is a very small request, and most people will do what the salesperson asks. (C) They make such purchases because the salesperson takes advantage of a human tendency to be consistent in their words and actions. People want to be consistent and will keep saying yes if they have already said it once. * petition: 청원서 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 7 영어 영역 7 8 37. Many studies have shown that people’s health and subjective well-being are affected by ethnic relations. Members of minority groups in general have poorer health outcomes than the majority group. (A) One possible answer is stress. From multiple physiological studies, we know that encounters with members of other ethnic-racial categories, even in the relatively safe environment of laboratories, trigger stress responses. (B) But that difference remains even when obvious factors, such as social class and access to medical services are controlled for. This suggests that dominance relations have their own effect on people’s health. How could that be the case? (C) Minority individuals have many encounters with majority individuals, each of which may trigger such responses. However minimal these effects may be, their frequency may increase total stress, which would account for part of the health disadvantage of minority individuals. [3점] ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) [38 ~ 39] 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳을 고르시오. 38. The stage director must gain the audience’s attention and direct their eyes to a particular spot or actor. Achieving focus in a movie is easy. Directors can simply point the camera at whatever they want the audience to look at. ( ①) Close-ups and slow camera shots can emphasize a killer’s hand or a character’s brief glance of guilt. ( ②) On stage, focus is much more difficult because the audience is free to look wherever they like. ( ③) This can be done through lighting, costumes, scenery, voice, and movements. ( ④) Focus can be gained by simply putting a spotlight on one actor, by having one actor in red and everyone else in gray, or by having one actor move while the others remain still. ( ⑤) All these techniques will quickly draw the audience’s attention to the actor whom the director wants to be in focus. 39. In this way, quick judgements are not only relevant in employment matters; they are equally applicable in love and relationship matters too. You’ve probably heard the expression, “first impressions matter a lot”. ( ①) Life really doesn’t give many people a second chance to make a good first impression. ( ②) It has been determined that it takes only a few seconds for anyone to assess another individual. ( ③) This is very noticeable in recruitment processes, where top recruiters can predict the direction of their eventual decision on any candidate within a few seconds of introducing themselves. ( ④) So, a candidate’s CV may ‘speak’ knowledge and competence, but their appearance and introduction may tell of a lack of coordination, fear, and poor interpersonal skills. ( ⑤) On a date with a wonderful somebody who you’ve painstakingly tracked down for months, subtle things like bad breath or wrinkled clothes may spoil your noble efforts. * CV: 이력서(curriculum vitae) 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? The perception of the same amount of discount on a product depends on its relation to the initial price. In one study, respondents were presented with a purchase situation. The persons put in the situation of buying a calculator that cost $15 found out from the vendor that the same product was available in a different store 20 minutes away and at a promotional price of $10. In this case, 68% of respondents decided to make their way down to the store in order to save $5. In the second condition, which involved buying a jacket for $125, the respondents were also told that the same product was available in a store 20 minutes away and cost $120 there. This time, only 29% of the persons said that they would get the cheaper jacket. In both cases, the product was $5 cheaper, but in the first case, the amount was 1/3 of the price, and in the second, it was 1/25 of the price. What differed in both of these situations was the price context of the purchase.  When the same amount of discount is given in a purchasing situation, the (A) value of the discount affects how people (B) its value.

Behavioral ecologists have observed clever copying behavior among many of our close animal relatives. One example was uncovered by behavioral ecologists studying the behavior of a small Australian animal called the quoll. Its survival was being (a) threatened by the cane toad, an invasive species introduced to Australia in the 1930s. To a quoll, these toads look as tasty as they are (b) poisonous, and the quolls who ate them suffered fatal consequences at a speedy rate. Behavioral ecologists identified a clever solution by using quolls’ instincts to imitate. Scientists fed small groups of quolls toad sausages containing harmless but nausea-inducing chemicals, conditioning them to (c) avoid the toads. Groups of these ‘toad-smart’ quolls were then released back into the wild: they taught their own offspring what they’d learned. Other quolls copied these (d) constructive behaviors through a process of social learning. As each baby quoll learned to keep away from the hazardous toads, the chances of the survival of the whole quoll species ― and not just that of each individual quoll ― were (e) reduced. The quolls were saved via minimal human interference because ecologists were able to take advantage of quolls’ natural imitative instincts. * nausea: 메스꺼움 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① Imitative Instinct as a Key to Survival for Animals ② Copy Quickly and Precisely to Be Productive ③ How to Stop the Spread of Invasive Species ④ The Role of Threats in Animal Cooperation ⑤ Ideal Habitats for Diverse Wildlife 42. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?

The hunter owned a few fierce and poorly-trained hunting dogs. They jumped the fence frequently and chased the farmer’s lambs. The farmer asked his neighbor to keep (a) his dogs in check, but his words fell on deaf ears. One day when the dogs jumped the fence, they attacked and severely injured several of the lambs. (B) To protect his sons’ newly acquired playmates, the hunter built a strong doghouse for his dogs. The dogs never bothered the farmer’s lambs again. Out of gratitude for the farmer’s generosity toward (b) his children, the hunter often invited the farmer for feasts. In turn, the farmer offered him lamb meat and cheese he had made. The farmer quickly developed a strong friendship with (c) him. (C) “All right, I will offer you a solution that keeps your lambs safe and will also turn your neighbor into a good friend.” Having heard the judge’s solution, the farmer agreed. As soon as the farmer reached home, he immediately put the judge’s suggestions to the test. (d) He selected three of the cutest lambs from his farm. He then presented them to his neighbor’s three small sons. The children accepted with joy and began to play with them. (D) The farmer had had enough by this point. He went to the nearest city to consult a judge. After listening carefully to his story, the judge said, “I could punish the hunter and instruct (e) him to keep his dogs chained or lock them up. But you would lose a friend and gain an enemy. Which would you rather have for a neighbor, a friend or an enemy?” The farmer replied that he preferred a friend. 43. 주어진 글 (A)에 이어질 내용을 순서에 맞게 배열한 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① (B) - (D) - (C) ② (C) - (B) - (D) ③ (C) - (D) - (B) ④ (D) - (B) - (C) ⑤ (D) - (C) - (B) 44. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? ①(a) ②(b) ③(c) ④(d) ⑤(e) 45. 윗글의 농부에 관한 내용으로 적절하지 않은 것은? ① 그의 양이 사냥개의 공격을 받았다. ② 사냥꾼에게 양고기와 치즈를 받았다. ③ 재판관의 해결책에 동의했다. ④ 세 명의 아들을 둔 이웃이 있었다. ⑤ 도시로 조언을 구하러 갔다. ※ 확인 사항 답안지의 해당란에 필요한 내용을 정확히 기입(표기)했는지 확인하시오."
