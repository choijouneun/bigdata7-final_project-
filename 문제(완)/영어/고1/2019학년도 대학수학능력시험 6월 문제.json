The Chief called for Little Fawn to come out, and took her right hand and Sam’s right hand and tied them together with a small piece of leather.

Fawn and Sam sat on blankets as young boys and girls began dancing to flute music and drum beats. They danced in circles making joyful sounds and shaking their hands with arms raised over their heads. Fawn rose up and joined them. People started clapping and singing. Fawn and Sam were two happy people. ① boring ② scary ③ calm ④ humorous ⑤ festive 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? You can buy conditions for happiness, but you can’t buy happiness. It’s like playing tennis. You can’t buy the joy of playing tennis at a store. You can buy the ball and the racket, but you can’t buy the joy of playing. To experience the joy of tennis, you have to learn, to train yourself to play. It’s the same with writing calligraphy. You can buy the ink, the rice paper, and the brush, but if you don’t cultivate the art of calligraphy, you can’t really do calligraphy. So calligraphy requires practice, and you have to train yourself. You are happy as a calligrapher only when you have the capacity to do calligraphy. Happiness is also like that. You have to cultivate happiness; you cannot buy it at a store. * calligraphy: 서예 ① 자기 계발에 도움이 되는 취미를 가져야 한다. ② 경기 시작 전 규칙을 정확히 숙지해야 한다. ③ 행복은 노력을 통해 길러가야 한다. ④ 성공하려면 목표부터 명확히 설정해야 한다. ⑤ 글씨를 예쁘게 쓰려면 연습을 반복해야 한다. 영어영역 3 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3 8 21. 밑줄 친 at the “sweet spot”이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] For almost all things in life, there can be too much of a good thing. Even the best things in life aren’t so great in excess. This concept has been discussed at least as far back as Aristotle. He argued that being virtuous means finding a balance. For example, people should be brave, but if someone is too brave they become reckless. People should be trusting, but if someone is too trusting they are considered gullible. For each of these traits, it is best to avoid both deficiency and excess. The best way is to live at the “sweet spot” that maximizes well­being. Aristotle’s suggestion is that virtue is the midpoint, where someone is neither too generous nor too stingy, neither too afraid nor recklessly brave. * excess: 과잉 ** gullible: 잘 속아 넘어가는 ① at the time of a biased decision ② in the area of material richness ③ away from social pressure ④ in the middle of two extremes ⑤ at the moment of instant pleasure 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? Certainly praise is critical to a child’s sense of self­esteem, but when given too often for too little, it kills the impact of real praise when it is called for. Everyone needs to know they are valued and appreciated, and praise is one way of expressing such feelings ― but only after something praiseworthy has been accomplished. Awards are supposed to be rewards ― reactions to positive actions, honors for doing something well! The ever­present danger in handing out such honors too lightly is that children may come to depend on them and do only those things that they know will result in prizes. If they are not sure they can do well enough to earn merit badges, or if gifts are not guaranteed, they may avoid certain activities. ① 올바른 습관은 어린 시절에 형성된다. ② 칭찬은 아이의 감성 발달에 필수적이다. ③ 아이에게 칭찬을 남발하지 않는 것이 중요하다. ④ 물질적 보상은 학습 동기 부여에 도움이 되지 않는다. ⑤ 아이에게 감정 표현의 기회를 충분히 줄 필요가 있다. 23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? If you’ve ever seen a tree stump, you probably noticed that the top of the stump had a series of rings. These rings can tell us how old the tree is, and what the weather was like during each year of the tree’s life. Because trees are sensitive to local climate conditions, such as rain and temperature, they give scientists some information about that area’s local climate in the past. For example, tree rings usually grow wider in warm, wet years and are thinner in years when it is cold and dry. If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all during that time. Very old trees in particular can offer clues about what the climate was like long before measurements were recorded. * stump: 그루터기 ① use of old trees to find direction ② traditional ways to predict weather ③ difficulty in measuring a tree’s age ④ importance of protecting local trees ⑤ tree rings suggesting the past climate 24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? Near an honesty box, in which people placed coffee fund contributions, researchers at Newcastle University in the UK alternately displayed images of eyes and of flowers. Each image was displayed for a week at a time. During all the weeks in which eyes were displayed, bigger contributions were made than during the weeks when flowers were displayed. Over the ten weeks of the study, contributions during the ‘eyes weeks’ were almost three times higher than those made during the ‘flowers weeks.’ It was suggested that ‘the evolved psychology of cooperation is highly sensitive to subtle cues of being watched,’ and that the findings may have implications for how to provide effective nudges toward socially beneficial outcomes. * nudge: 넌지시 권하기 ① Is Honesty the Best Policy? ② Flowers Work Better than Eyes ③ Contributions Can Increase Self­Respect ④ The More Watched, The Less Cooperative ⑤ Eyes: Secret Helper to Make Society Better 영어영역 4 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4 8 25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The above graph shows the smartphone average prices in China and India between 2010 and 2015, compared with the global smartphone average price during the same period. ①The global smartphone average price decreased from 2010 to 2015, but still stayed the highest among the three. ②The smartphone average price in China dropped between 2010 and 2013. ③The smartphone average price in India reached its peak in 2011. ④From 2013, China and India took opposite paths, with China’s smartphone average price going down and India’s going up. ⑤The gap between the global smartphone average price and the smartphone average price in China was the smallest in 2015. 26. James Van Der Zee에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? James Van Der Zee was born on June 29, 1886, in Lenox, Massachusetts. The second of six children, James grew up in a family of creative people. At the age of fourteen he received his first camera and took hundreds of photographs of his family and town. By 1906, he had moved to New York, married, and was taking jobs to support his growing family. In 1907, he moved to Phoetus, Virginia, where he worked in the dining room of the Hotel Chamberlin. During this time he also worked as a photographer on a part­time basis. He opened his own studio in 1916. World WarⅠhad begun and many young soldiers came to the studio to have their pictures taken. In 1969, the exhibition, Harlem On My Mind, brought him international recognition. He died in 1983. ① 여섯 명의 아이들 중 둘째였다. ② 열네 살에 그의 첫 번째 카메라를 받았다. ③ Chamberlin 호텔의 식당에서 일을 했다. ④ 자신의 스튜디오를 1916년에 열었다. ⑤ 1969년에 전시회로 인해 국제적인 비난을 받았다. 27. Summer Camp 2019에 관한 다음 안내문의 내용과 일치하는 것은?

Bad lighting can increase stress on your eyes, as can light that is too bright, or light that shines ①directly into your eyes. Fluorescent lighting can also be ②tiring. What you may not appreciate is that the quality of light may also be important. Most people are happiest in bright sunshine ― this may cause a release of chemicals in the body ③that bring a feeling of emotional well­being. Artificial light, which typically contains only a few wavelengths of light, ④do not seem to have the same effect on mood that sunlight has.

[3점] School assignments have typically required that students work alone. This emphasis on (A) collective / individual productivity reflected an opinion that independence is a necessary factor for success.

Consequently, teachers in the past (B) more / less often arranged group work or encouraged students to acquire teamwork skills. However, since the new millennium, businesses have experienced more global competition that requires improved productivity.

Creativity is a skill we usually consider uniquely human. For all of human history, we have been the most creative beings on Earth. Birds can make their nests, ants can make their hills, but no other species on Earth comes close to the level of creativity we humans display. However, just in the last decade we have acquired the ability to do amazing things with computers, like developing robots. With the artificial intelligence boom of the 2010s, computers can now recognize faces, translate languages, take calls for you, write poems, and beat players at the world’s most complicated board game, to name a few things. All of a sudden, we must face the possibility that our ability to be creative is not . [3점] ① unrivaled ② learned ③ universal ④ ignored ⑤ challenged 32. There is a major problem with . To determine the number of objects by counting, such as determining how many apples there are on a table, many children would touch or point to the first apple and say “one,” then move on to the second apple and say “two,” and continue in this manner until all the apples are counted. If we start at 0, we would have to touch nothing and say “zero,” but then we would have to start touching apples and calling out “one, two, three” and so on. This can be very confusing because there would be a need to stress when to touch and when not to touch. If a child accidentally touches an apple while saying “zero,” then the total number of apples will be off by 1.

The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information ― this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists create from a place of no­mind, from inner stillness. Even great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising result of a nationwide inquiry among America’s most famous mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking “plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.” So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don’t know how to think, but because they don’t know how to ! * quietude: 정적 ** subordinate: 부수적인 ① organize their ideas ② interact socially ③ stop thinking ④ gather information ⑤ use their imagination 34. We are more likely to eat in a restaurant if we know that it is usually busy. Even when nobody tells us a restaurant is good, our herd behavior determines our decision­making. Let’s suppose you walk toward two empty restaurants. You do not know which one to enter. However, you suddenly see a group of six people enter one of them. Which one are you more likely to enter, the empty one or the other one? Most people would go into the restaurant with people in it. Let’s suppose you and a friend go into that restaurant. Now, it has eight people in it. Others see that one restaurant is empty and the other has eight people in it. So, . * herd: 무리, 떼 ① both restaurants are getting busier ② you and your friend start hesitating ③ your decision has no impact on others’ ④ they reject what lots of other people do ⑤ they decide to do the same as the other eight 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Words like ‘near’ and ‘far’ can mean different things depending on where you are and what you are doing. If you were at a zoo, then you might say you are ‘near’ an animal if you could reach out and touch it through the bars of its cage. ①Here the word ‘near’ means an arm’s length away. ②If you were telling someone how to get to your local shop, you might call it ‘near’ if it was a five­minute walk away. ③It seems that you had better walk to the shop to improve your health. ④Now the word ‘near’ means much longer than an arm’s length away. ⑤Words like ‘near’, ‘far’, ‘small’, ‘big’, ‘hot’, and ‘cold’ all mean different things to different people at different times.

Soon after, Simón Bolívar, the general who had led the liberating forces, called a meeting to write the first version of the constitution for the new country. (A) “Then,” said Bolívar, “I’ll add whatever is necessary to this million pesos you have given me and I will buy all the slaves in Peru and set them free. It makes no sense to free a nation, unless all its citizens enjoy freedom as well.” (B) Bolívar accepted the gift and then asked, “How many slaves are there in Peru?” He was told there were about three thousand. “And how much does a slave sell for?” he wanted to know. “About 350 pesos for a man,” was the answer. (C) After the meeting, the people wanted to do something special for Bolívar to show their appreciation for all he had done for them, so they offered him a gift of one million pesos, a very large amount of money in those days. * constitution: 헌법 ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 영어영역 7 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 7 8 37.

(A) It might be easier if you describe patterns of stars. You could say something like, “See that big triangle of bright stars there?” Or, “Do you see those five stars that look like a big letter W?” (B) But this amazing sight of stars can also be confusing. Try and point out a single star to someone. Chances are, that person will have a hard time knowing exactly which star you’re looking at. (C) When you do that, you’re doing exactly what we all do when we look at the stars. We look for patterns, not just so that we can point something out to someone else, but also because that’s what we humans have always done.

When the boy learned that he had misspelled the word, he went to the judges and told them. Some years ago at the national spelling bee in Washington, D.C., a thirteen­year­old boy was asked to spell echolalia, a word that means a tendency to repeat whatever one hears. ( ①) Although he misspelled the word, the judges misheard him, told him he had spelled the word right, and allowed him to advance. ( ②) So he was eliminated from the competition after all. ( ③) Newspaper headlines the next day called the honest young man a “spelling bee hero,” and his photo appeared in The New York Times.

Instead of that, say to them, ‘I can’t deal with that now but what I can do is I can ask Brian to give you a hand and he should be able to explain them.’ Whenever you say what you can’t do, say what you can do.

( ①) Consider this situation ― a colleague comes up to you and asks you to look over some figures with them before a meeting they are having tomorrow. ( ②) You simply say, ‘No, I can’t deal with this now.’ ( ③) This may then lead to them insisting how important your input is, increasing the pressure on you to give in.

In one study, researchers looked at how people respond to life challenges including getting a job, taking an exam, or undergoing surgery. For each of these conditions, the researchers also measured how much these participants fantasized about positive outcomes and how much they actually expected a positive outcome. What’s the difference really between fantasy and expectation? While fantasy involves imagining an idealized future, expectation is actually based on a person’s past experiences. So what did the researchers find? The results revealed that those who had engaged in fantasizing about the desired future did worse in all three conditions. Those who had more positive expectations for success did better in the following weeks, months, and years. These individuals were more likely to have found jobs, passed their exams, or successfully recovered from their surgery.  Positive expectations are more (A) than fantasizing about a desired future, and they are likely to increase your chances of (B) in achieving goals.

Many advertisements cite statistical surveys. But we should be (a) cautious because we usually do not know how these surveys are conducted. For example, a toothpaste manufacturer once had a poster that said, “More than 80% of dentists recommend Smiley Toothpaste.” This seems to say that most dentists (b) prefer Smiley Toothpaste to other brands. But it turns out that the survey questions allowed the dentists to recommend more than one brand, and in fact another competitor’s brand was recommended just as often as Smiley Toothpaste! No wonder the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled in 2007 that the poster was (c) misleading and it could no longer be displayed. A similar case concerns a well­known cosmetics firm marketing a cream that is supposed to rapidly reduce wrinkles. But the only evidence provided is that “76% of 50 women agreed.” But what this means is that the evidence is based on just the personal opinions from a small sample with no objective measurement of their skin’s condition. Furthermore, we are not told how these women were selected. Without such information, the “evidence” provided is pretty much (d) useful. Unfortunately, such advertisements are quite typical, and as consumers we just have to use our own judgment and (e) avoid taking advertising claims too seriously. 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① The Link between Advertisements and the Economy ② Are Statistical Data in Advertisements Reliable? ③ Statistics in Advertisements Are Objective! ④ The Bright Side of Public Advertisements ⑤ Quality or Price, Which Matters More? 42. 밑줄 친 (a)~(e) 중에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?

An old man whom society would consider a beggar was coming toward him from across the parking lot. From the looks of him, (a) he seemed to have no home and no money. There are times when you feel generous but there are other times when you just don’t want to be bothered. * wipe off: 닦다 (B) Kevin also needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but he needed help. He opened his wallet. And Kevin gave (b) him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you have accomplished, you need help too. No matter how little you have, no matter how loaded you are with problems, even without money or a place to sleep, you can give help. (C) This was one of those “don’t want to be bothered” times. “I hope the old man doesn’t ask me for any money,” Kevin thought. He didn’t. He came and sat on the bench in front of the bus stop but he didn’t look like he could have enough money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke. “That’s a very pretty car,” he said. He was ragged but (c) he had an air of dignity around him. Kevin said, “Thanks,” and continued wiping off his car. * dignity: 위엄 (D) He sat there quietly as Kevin worked.
