Dear Mr. John Smith, I am a staff member at the Eastville Library, and I work weekday afternoons. Each day, as school closes, dozens of students come to the library to do homework, use the library’s computers, or socialize in a safe place. Many of these children would otherwise go home to empty houses, and the library is the one place that provides a secure, supervised alternative to being home alone. Your proposed policy of closing libraries on Mondays as a cost cutting measure could be harmful to these children, and I’m certain there are other ways to save money. I urge you and other city council representatives to cancel the plan and to keep libraries open! Sincerely, Kyle Tucker ① 도서관 신설을 위한 예산 확보를 부탁하려고 ② 도서관 정기 휴관 정책의 취소를 요청하려고 ③ 도서관 직원의 근무 환경 개선을 제안하려고 ④ 도서관 안전 점검 일정에 대해 문의하려고 ⑤ 도서관 컴퓨터 추가 구입을 건의하려고 19. 다음 글에 드러난 Clara의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? Clara, an 11-year-old girl, sat in the back seat of her mother’s car with the window down. The wind from outside blew her brown hair across her ivory pale skin ― she sighed deeply. She was sad about moving and was not smiling. Her heart felt like it hurt. The fact that she had to leave everything she knew broke her heart. Eleven years ― that was a long time to be in one place and build memories and make friends. She had been able to finish out the school year with her friends, which was nice, but she feared she would face the whole summer and the coming school year alone. Clara sighed heavily. ① calm and relaxed ② jealous and irritated ③ excited and amused ④ bored and indifferent ⑤ sorrowful and worried 20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? If you were at a social gathering in a large building and you overheard someone say that “the roof is on fire,” what would be your reaction? Until you knew more information, your first inclination might be toward safety and survival. But if you were to find out that this particular person was talking about a song called “The Roof Is on Fire,” your feelings of threat and danger would be diminished. So once the additional facts are understood ― that the person was referring to a song and not a real fire ― the context is better understood and you are in a better position to judge and react. All too often people react far too quickly and emotionally over information without establishing context. It is so important for us to identify context related to information because if we fail to do so, we may judge and react too quickly. ① 갈등을 해결하려면 상대방의 감정을 파악해야 한다. ② 정보에 대해 판단하고 반응하기 전에 맥락을 확인해야 한다. ③ 위험한 상황에 처할 때일수록 타인의 의견을 경청해야 한다. ④ 많은 정보보다 정확한 정보 제공을 통해 신뢰성을 높여야 한다. ⑤ 신속한 의사결정을 위해 핵심 정보와 주변 정보를 구별해야 한다.

Imagine that your body is a battery and the more energy this battery can store, the more energy you will be able to have within a day. Every night when you sleep, this battery is recharged with as much energy as you spent during the previous day. If you want to have a lot of energy tomorrow, you need to spend a lot of energy today. Our brain consumes only 20% of our energy, so it’s a must to supplement thinking activities with walking and exercises that spend a lot of energy, so that your internal battery has more energy tomorrow. Your body stores as much energy as you need: for thinking, for moving, for doing exercises. The more active you are today, the more energy you spend today and the more energy you will have to burn tomorrow. Exercising gives you more energy and keeps you from feeling exhausted. * supplement: 보충하다 ① 많은 에너지를 얻기 위해 적극적인 신체 활동이 필요하다. ② 가벼운 산책을 통해 창의적 사고력을 증진할 수 있다. ③ 에너지의 소비와 회복의 불균형은 건강을 해친다. ④ 과도한 운동은 효율적인 두뇌 활동을 방해할 수 있다. ⑤ 원활한 에너지 충전을 위해서는 충분한 수면이 중요하다. 22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? When we read a number, we are more influenced by the leftmost digit than by the rightmost, since that is the order in which we read, and process, them. The number 799 feels significantly less than 800 because we see the former as 7-something and the latter as 8-something, whereas 798 feels pretty much like 799. Since the nineteenth century, shopkeepers have taken advantage of this trick by choosing prices ending in a 9, to give the impression that a product is cheaper than it is. Surveys show that around a third to two-thirds of all retail prices now end in a 9. Though we are all experienced shoppers, we are still fooled. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern Brittany monitored a local pizza restaurant that was serving five types of pizza at €8.00 each. When one of the pizzas was reduced in price to €7.99, its share of sales rose from a third of the total to a half. ① pricing strategy using the way people read numbers ② consumption patterns reflecting local economic trends ③adding numbers to strengthen the credibility of sellers ④ causal relationship between market sizes and product prices ⑤ sales tricks to fool customers by changing store environments 23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? In a competitive environment, such as a college admissions process or a job application situation, almost everyone has strong qualifications. Almost everyone has facts in their favor. But how valuable are facts alone? Think back to the most recent lecture or presentation you attended. How many facts do you remember from it? If you’re like most people, you can’t recall many, if any. Chances are good, however, that you remember stories, anecdotes, and examples from the event, even if you can’t think of their exact context. The average person today is flooded with facts and data, and we let most of this pass through our brains with minimal retention or reaction ― unless something makes the information stand out in a meaningful way. That’s where story comes in. * retention: 기억 ① Make Yourself Outstanding by Using Accurate Terms ② The Power of Story: Why We Need More Than Facts ③ What Is the Key Qualification of a Storyteller? ④ How Big Is Our Average Memory Capacity? ⑤ A Single Fact Is Worth a Whole Story 24. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? The Number of Jobs Directly Created by Travel and Tourism The above graph shows the number of jobs directly created by travel and tourism in 2016 and 2017 for five regions. ①The number of jobs directly generated by travel and tourism in North East Asia and South Asia was greater in 2017 than in 2016. ②Of the five regions, North East Asia showed the highest number in direct job creation by travel and tourism in 2017, with 30.49 million jobs. ③In 2016, the number of jobs in South Asia that travel and tourism directly contributed was the largest of the five regions, but it ranked the second highest in 2017. ④Though the number of jobs in North America directly created by travel and tourism was lower in 2017 than in 2016, it still exceeded 10 million in 2017. ⑤In 2017, travel and tourism directly contributed 5.71 million jobs in Latin America, which was over six times more than those of Oceania in 2017. 4 영어 영역 4 8 25. Charles Henry Turner에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? Born in 1867 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Charles Henry Turner was an early pioneer in the field of insect behavior. His father owned an extensive library where Turner became fascinated with reading about the habits and behavior of insects. Proceeding with his study, Turner earned a doctorate degree in zoology, the first African American to do so. Even after receiving his degree, Turner was unable to get a teaching or research position at any major universities, possibly as a result of racism. He moved to St. Louis and taught biology at Sumner High School, focusing on research there until 1922. Turner was the first person to discover that insects are capable of learning, illustrating that insects can alter behavior based on previous experience. He died of cardiac disease in Chicago in 1923. During his 33-year career, Turner published more than 70 papers. His last scientific paper was published the year after his death. * cardiac: 심장의 ① 곤충의 습성과 행동에 관한 독서에 매료되었다. ② 아프리카계 미국인 최초로 동물학 박사 학위를 받았다. ③ Sumner 고등학교에서 생물학을 가르쳤다. ④ 곤충이 학습할 수 있다는 것을 최초로 발견했다. ⑤ 마지막 과학 논문은 사망한 해에 발표되었다. 26.

[3점] The belief that humans have morality and animals don’t is such a longstanding assumption that it could well be called a habit of mind, and bad habits, as we all know, are extremely hard ①to break. A lot of people have caved in to this assumption because it is easier to deny morality to animals than to deal with the complex effects of the possibility ②that animals have moral behavior. The historical tendency, framed in the outdated dualism of us versus them, ③is strong enough to make a lot of people cling to the status quo. Denial of who animals are ④convenient allows for maintaining false stereotypes about the cognitive and emotional capacities of animals. Clearly a major paradigm shift is needed, because the lazy acceptance of habits of mind has a strong influence on ⑤how animals are understood and treated. * dualism: 이원론(二元論) ** status quo: 현재 상태 5 영어 영역 5 8 29. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] We notice repetition among confusion, and the opposite: we notice a break in a repetitive pattern. But how do these arrangements make us feel? And what about “perfect” regularity and “perfect” chaos? Some repetition gives us a sense of security, in that we know what is coming next. We like some (A) predictability / unpredictability . We arrange our lives in largely repetitive schedules. Randomness, in organization or in events, is more challenging and more frightening for most of us. With “perfect” chaos we are (B) excited / frustrated by having to adapt and react again and again. But “perfect” regularity is perhaps even more horrifying in its monotony than randomness is. It (C) denies / implies a cold, unfeeling, mechanical quality. Such perfect order does not exist in nature; there are too many forces working against each other. Either extreme, therefore, feels threatening.

Albert Einstein once boarded a train from Philadelphia. The conductor came around to punch the tickets and said, “Ticket, please.” Einstein reached into his vest pocket for the ticket, but did not find it. ①He checked his jacket pocket. No ticket. He checked his brief case. But still, ②he could not find his ticket. The conductor, noting ③his obvious distress, kindly said, “I know who you are, Dr. Einstein. Don’t worry about your ticket.” Several minutes later the conductor turned around from the front of the traincar to see Einstein continuing to search under ④his seat for the missing ticket. Quickly, he hurried back to assure the gray-haired gentleman. “Dr. Einstein, Dr. Einstein, I know who you are!” ⑤he repeated. “Please don’t worry about your ticket.” Dr. Einstein slowly arose from his knees and addressed the young conductor. “Son, you don’t understand. I, too, know who I am. What I don’t know is where I’m going.” [31 ~ 34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 31. If you follow science news, you will have noticed that among animals has become a hot topic in the mass media. For example, in late 2007 the science media widely reported a study by Claudia Rutte and Michael Taborsky suggesting that rats display what they call “generalized reciprocity.” They each provided help to an unfamiliar and unrelated individual, based on their own previous experience of having been helped by an unfamiliar rat. Rutte and Taborsky trained rats in a cooperative task of pulling a stick to obtain food for a partner. Rats who had been helped previously by an unknown partner were more likely to help others. Before this research was conducted, generalized reciprocity was thought to be unique to humans. ① friction ② diversity ③ hierarchy ④ cooperation ⑤ independence 32. We have to recognize that there always exists in us the strongest need to utilize all our attention. And this is quite evident in the great amount of displeasure we feel any time the entirety of our capacity for attention is not being put to use. When this is the case, we will seek . If we are playing a chess game with a weaker opponent, we will seek to supplement this activity with another: such as watching TV, or listening to music, or playing another chess game at the same time. Very often this reveals itself in unconscious movements, such as playing with something in one’s hands or pacing around the room; and if such an action also serves to increase pleasure or relieve displeasure, all the better. * supplement: 보충하다 ① to please others with what we are good at ② to pay more attention to the given task ③ to find outlets for our unused attention ④ to play with a stronger opponent ⑤ to give our brain a short break 6 영어 영역 6 8 33. From an economic perspective, a short-lived event can become an innovative event if it generates goods and services that can be sold to people, in particular to those from outside the locality. The remarkable growth of art exhibitions, cultural festivals and sports competitions, for example, can be analysed in this light. They are temporary activities that can attract large numbers of outsiders to a locality, bringing in new sources of income. But even here, there is a two-way interaction between the event and the context. The existence of an infrastructure, a reputation, a history of an activity for an area may have important effects on the economic success or failure of an event. In other words, events do not take place in a vacuum. They depend on an existing context which has been in the making for a long time. The short-lived event, therefore, would . [3점] * infrastructure: 기반 시설 ① build a new context with other short-lived events ② take place free from this spatial and temporal limit ③ be performed in relation to this long-term context ④ interact with well-known events from another locality ⑤ evolve itself from a local event to a global one in the end 34. Interestingly, in nature, . The distinction between predator and prey offers a clarifying example of this. The key feature that distinguishes predator species from prey species isn’t the presence of claws or any other feature related to biological weaponry. The key feature is the position of their eyes. Predators evolved with eyes facing forward ― which allows for binocular vision that offers accurate depth perception when pursuing prey. Prey, on the other hand, often have eyes facing outward, maximizing peripheral vision, which allows the hunted to detect danger that may be approaching from any angle. Consistent with our place at the top of the food chain, humans have eyes that face forward. We have the ability to gauge depth and pursue our goals, but we can also miss important action on our periphery. [3점] * depth perception: 거리 감각 ** periphery: 주변 ① eyes facing outward are linked with the success of hunting ② the more powerful species have a narrower field of vision ③ humans’ eyes facing forward enable them to detect danger ④ eyesight is closely related to the extinction of weak species ⑤ animals use their eyesight to identify members of their species 35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could take your customers by the hand and guide each one through your store while pointing out all the great products you would like them to consider buying? ①Most people, however, would not particularly enjoy having a stranger grab their hand and drag them through a store. ②Rather, let the store do it for you. ③Have a central path that leads shoppers through the store and lets them look at many different departments or product areas. ④You can use this effect of music on shopping behavior by playing it in the store. ⑤This path leads your customers from the entrance through the store on the route you want them to take all the way to the checkout. [36 ~ 37] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 36. Color can impact how you perceive weight. Dark colors look heavy, and bright colors look less so. Interior designers often paint darker colors below brighter colors to put the viewer at ease. (A) In fact, black is perceived to be twice as heavy as white. Carrying the same product in a black shopping bag, versus a white one, feels heavier. So, small but expensive products like neckties and accessories are often sold in dark-colored shopping bags or cases. (B) In contrast, shelving dark-colored products on top can create the illusion that they might fall over, which can be a source of anxiety for some shoppers. Black and white, which have a brightness of 0% and 100%, respectively, show the most dramatic difference in perceived weight. (C) Product displays work the same way. Place bright-colored products higher and dark-colored products lower, given that they are of similar size. This will look more stable and allow customers to comfortably browse the products from top to bottom. ① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C) ③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B) ⑤ (C) - (B) - (A) 7 영어 영역 7 8 37. Ethical and moral systems are different for every culture. According to cultural relativism, all of these systems are equally valid, and no system is better than another. (A) There exists an inherent logical inconsistency in cultural relativism, however. If one accepts the idea that there is no right or wrong, then there exists no way to make judgments in the first place. To deal with this inconsistency, cultural relativism creates “tolerance.” (B) The basis of cultural relativism is the notion that no true standards of good and evil actually exist. Therefore, judging whether something is right or wrong is based on individual societies’ beliefs, and any moral or ethical opinions are affected by an individual’s cultural perspective. (C) However, with tolerance comes intolerance, which means that tolerance must imply some sort of ultimate good. Thus, tolerance also goes against the very notion of cultural relativism, and the boundaries of logic make cultural relativism impossible.

However, as society becomes more diverse, the likelihood that people share assumptions and values diminishes. The way we communicate influences our ability to build strong and healthy communities. Traditional ways of building communities have emphasized debate and argument. ( ①) For example, the United States has a strong tradition of using town hall meetings to deliberate important issues within communities. ( ②) In these settings, advocates for each side of the issue present arguments for their positions, and public issues have been discussed in such public forums. ( ③) Yet for debate and argument to work well, people need to come to such forums with similar assumptions and values. ( ④) The shared assumptions and values serve as a foundation for the discussion. ( ⑤) As a result, forms of communication such as argument and debate become polarized, which may drive communities apart as opposed to bringing them together. 39. Such critics are usually unaware of the real nature of social science and of its special problems and basic limitations. Some people believe that the social sciences are falling behind the natural sciences. ( ①) They maintain that not only does social science have no exact laws, but it also has failed to eliminate great social evils such as racial discrimination, crime, poverty, and war. ( ②) They suggest that social scientists have failed to accomplish what might reasonably have been expected of them. ( ③) For example, they forget that the solution to a social problem requires not only knowledge but also the ability to influence people. ( ④) Even if social scientists discover the procedures that could reasonably be followed to achieve social improvement, they are seldom in a position to control social action. ( ⑤) For that matter, even dictators find that there are limits to their power to change society. [3점] 40. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? We cannot predict the outcomes of sporting contests, which vary from week to week. This heterogeneity is a feature of sport. It is the uncertainty of the result and the quality of the contest that consumers find attractive. For the sport marketer, this is problematic, as the quality of the contest cannot be guaranteed, no promises can be made in relations to the result and no assurances can be given in respect of the performance of star players. Unlike consumer products, sport cannot and does not display consistency as a key feature of marketing strategies. The sport marketer therefore must avoid marketing strategies based solely on winning, and must instead focus on developing product extensions such as the facility, parking, merchandise, souvenirs, food and beverages rather than on the core product (that is, the game itself). * heterogeneity: 이질성(異質性)  Sport has the essential nature of being (A) , which requires that its marketing strategies (B) products and services more than just the sports match.

Plants are nature’s alchemists; they are expert at transforming water, soil, and sunlight into an array of precious substances. Many of these substances are beyond the ability of human beings to conceive. While we were perfecting consciousness and learning to walk on two feet, they were, by the same process of natural selection, inventing photosynthesis (the astonishing trick of converting sunlight into food) and perfecting organic chemistry. As it turns out, many of the plants’ discoveries in chemistry and physics have served us well. From plants come chemical compounds that nourish and heal and delight the senses. Why would they go to all this trouble? Why should plants bother to devise the recipes for so many complex molecules and then expend the energy needed to manufacture them? Plants can’t move, which means they can’t escape the creatures that feed on them. A great many of the chemicals plants produce are designed, by natural selection, to compel other creatures to leave them alone: deadly poisons, foul flavors, toxins to confuse the minds of predators. Plants also can’t change location or extend their reproductive range without help. Many other of the substances plants make draw other creatures to them by stirring and gratifying their desire. It is this fact of plants’ that causes them to make chemicals. 41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? ① Why Plants Need Photosynthesis to Survive ② Manage Unwanted Plants with New Chemicals ③ How Plants Became Nature’s Chemical Producers ④ Adaptation Is Not a Necessity But a Choice for Plants ⑤ The Constant Survival Game Between Plants and Animals 42. 윗글의 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?

It was already late evening but there was no sign of the old man. Doubts filled (b) him. What if the old man does not return with the money? He regretted fixing up the old man’s bicycle. Suddenly (c) he lost all hope and he could wait no longer. He locked up his shop later than usual and cursed himself for getting tricked by an old man. (C) At home, Rangan was confused. Washing his greasy hands, he heard a knock at his door. It was the old man and the tea boy. The old man said, “Your shop was closed when I returned. Luckily, I saw this boy in front of the shop.” Handing over the money to Rangan, he continued, “Thanks for your hospitality.” Rangan grinned at the kind words the old man spoke to (d) him. The fact that he had suspected the old man pained his heart. (D) Rangan’s thoughts were disturbed by an old man walking with his bicycle towards his shop. The old man was wearing an old turban on his head. His hands and face were covered in wrinkles. In a gloomy tone, (e) he said, “Would you please replace the tire?
